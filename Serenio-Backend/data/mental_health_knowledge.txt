Introduc4on
Overcoming Depression
Depression is o^en called the “common cold” of mental health problems. Almost all of us
experience at least a mild depression from 4me to 4me and an es4mated one-third of adults
will experience a significant depression in their life4me.
There are many types of depression. A person with Persistent Depressive Disorder will be
depressed for at least two years and will have episodes of major depression mixed with less
severe symptoms. Seasonal Affec4ve Disorder comes during the winter months when there is
less sunlight and is usually alleviated in the spring, but its impact during the winter months
cannot be underes4mated. Bipolar Disorder is characterized by depression combined with
periodic highs, which can include feelings of euphoria and also irritability. Depression is
frequently found with other problems as well, including addic4ons, marital problems, and workrelated stress.
If you are depressed, your diagnosis will depend on how many symptoms you are experiencing
and how long they last. Symptoms of depression include:
• Depressed mood, sadness, or an “empty” feeling
• Loss of interest or pleasure in ac4vi4es you once enjoyed
• Significant weight loss when not die4ng or significant weight gain
• Inability to sleep or excessive sleeping
• Restlessness or irrita4on
• Fa4gue or loss of energy
• Feelings of worthlessness, or excessive or inappropriate guilt
• Difficulty thinking or concentra4ng or indecisiveness
• Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide* with or without a specific plan
*Important: If you are thinking about suicide, even if it is only once in a while, call the Na4onal
Suicide Preven4on Lifeline immediately. Their counselors are available 24/7/365 with
confiden4al help and they will connect you to a network of services across the country. Call
1-800-273-8255 or visit their website hZps://suicidepreven4onlifeline.org/.

What This Workbook Can Do for You
This workbook is designed to be used as part of your treatment with a psychotherapist or
counselor. While you might find the worksheets are helpful at relieving your depression without
addi4onal help, seeing a qualified therapist or counselor will help you make much quicker
progress in overcoming your depression. Depression can be complicated and can o^en be
accompanied by other kinds of problems, such as anxiety disorders, which will need different
kinds of treatment. A professional therapist or counselor will help you focus on the things you
can do to get both immediate and long-term relief from your depression.
The standard treatment for depression involves teaching clients specific psychological skills to
stop the downward spiral of unhappiness, nega4vism, and self-defea4ng behaviors. The
worksheets in this book are based on the most recent thinking in Cogni4ve Behavioral Therapy,
which is considered to be the “gold standard” in the treatment of depression.
The skills and behaviors you will learn in this workbook can quite literally change the way your
brain works. We have hundreds of studies that show us that when people prac4ce certain
behaviors, the biochemicals in their brain change. These ac4vi4es can increase the biochemicals
that we associate with a sense of well-being, including serotonin (calmness and contentment),
oxytocin (love and connec4on to others), dopamine (pleasure), and endorphins (relaxa4on and
posi4ve feelings). As you prac4ce the exercises in this workbook, you will be ac4vely s4mula4ng
these important biochemicals.
Beyond Depression: Why Not Be Happy?
In the last twenty years, psychologists have started looking beyond just trea4ng the symptoms
of depression and have also focused their treatment on techniques that can help people find a
happier and more fulfilling life. Many of the worksheets in this workbook are derived from
research on why some people seem to be happier than others, and you may be surprised at
how liZle it takes to make this happen.
Researchers tell us that we all have a “set point” for happiness, a predisposi4on toward a
specific point on a con4nuum between being happy or depressed. In other words, you were
born with a predisposi4on toward a certain level of happiness, just as you were born with a
predisposi4on to be a certain weight. But like with your weight, your behavior can make a
difference in your happiness. When you learn to prac4ce a “diet” of behaviors that increase
happiness, you can defy your gene4c predisposi4on as well as your par4cular life circumstances.
It doesn’t maZer whether you are rich or poor, tall or short, married or single, you always have
it in your power to be happy.
How to Use This Workbook
The forty-four exercises in this workbook are organized into seven sec4ons.
ii
Understanding Your Depression
The worksheets in this sec4on will help you understand the reasons that you are depressed and
will help mo4vate you to change. Depression affects different people in different ways, and you
may have problems caused by your depression that you aZribute to other things in your life.
Understanding your depression will help you focus on the specific things you can do to feel
beZer sooner.
Increasing Posi9ve Feelings
The worksheets in this sec4on will focus you on ac4vi4es that can li^ your mood and develop
the “habit of happiness.” You may have been depressed for so long that you have forgoZen
what it feels like to be happy and have posi4ve feelings about yourself and others. Fortunately,
there are rela4vely simple ways to li^ your mood; once you incorporate these into your daily
life, you might start to feel happier in just a few weeks.
New Ways to Think
For nearly fi^y years we’ve known that changing the way you think can change the way that you
feel. The worksheets in this sec4on will help you understand how your irra4onal thinking can
make your depression worse, how giving up nega4ve judgments about others can make you feel
beZer about yourself, and how you can develop a more nurturing inner voice.
New Ways to Act
Overcoming depression takes work. But when you commit yourself to making daily changes in
your life, you can learn to control your emo4ons rather than having them control you. Some of
the changes that will help your depression involve basic lifestyle habits, like making sure you eat
nutri4ous meals and get enough sleep. Other ac4vi4es ask you to commit yourself to doing
things you enjoy and ac4ng with kindness and compassion toward others. You may be surprised
how liZle changes in your daily behavior can make a big difference in how you feel.
Coping with Stress and Difficult Feelings
Some4mes life is very hard. You might lose your job, get a divorce, or even suffer from the loss
of a loved one. There are many everyday things that can cause you to feel sadness and stress as
well, but these things don’t have to make you depressed. This sec4on teaches you techniques to
tolerate difficult 4mes and develop habits that will make you more resilient even when 4mes
are tough.
Connec9ng to Others
People who are depressed tend to isolate themselves and even hide their problems from those
who care about them. The worksheets in this sec4on will help you fight the ins4nct to “go it
alone” and help you realize that there are many people in your life who can help you in
overcoming your depression.
iii
Crea9ng a Permanent Change
Many people suffer from symptoms of depression throughout their life4me, but this can stop!
Of course, you will be sad and even unhappy at 4mes—that is all part of being human—but you
can learn to recognize when normal stresses and emo4ons turn into needless suffering. The
worksheets in this sec4on will help you iden4fy the things that have helped you overcome your
depression, help you recognize the things that can cause setbacks, and help you monitor any
medica4ons that you are taking for your depression.
There is no right or wrong place to start this workbook. All of the techniques in this book will be
helpful. If you are in therapy for your depression, you should discuss where to start with your
therapist or counselor. He or she might feel that there are some specific things you can do that
will have the most immediate impact.
Above all, is it is important to be pa4ent with yourself and persist in using these techniques
even though they may at 4mes be difficult. The treatment of depression, or any mental health
problem for that maZer, can quite literally change the way your brain works, but this can take
some 4me.
We wish you the best in working to overcome your depression. If you are looking for addi4onal
resources, we recommend using the website of the American Associa4on for Anxiety and
Depression, which can be found at hZps://www.adaa.org/.

When would you say you first started to have symptoms of depression?
What was going on in your life at that 4me?
Does Your Depression Physically Hurt?
Depression o^en hurts physically as well as emo4onally. That’s because the same biochemicals
that influence your mood also affect how your body interprets pain.
If you are experiencing any of the following health issues, it could be linked to your depression.
It is important to address these physical symptoms, along with your depression.
• Headaches (for those who experience migraines, these may be worse)
• Back pain
• Muscle aches and joint pain
• Diges4ve problems (nausea, stomachache, diarrhea, cons4pa4on)
• Exhaus4on and fa4gue (regardless of sleep)
• Sleeping problems (insomnia or oversleeping)
• Change in appe4te or weight
• Dizziness or lightheadedness
For the next week, keep track of any physical symptoms you experience, and rate each on a
scale of 1–5, with 5 being the worst.

Mo4va4ng Yourself to Change
Some of the most debilita4ng symptoms of depression are lethargy, hopelessness, and a sense
that things will never get beZer.
So how are you going to mo4vate yourself to do the assignments in this workbook? Let’s face it,
change is not easy. But research on mo4va4on tells us that there are many techniques that can
help. Read through the ten mo4va4on 4ps below and then go back and rate each as to whether
you think it would be helpful for you to use to make changes to overcome your depression. Rate
each technique on a seven-point scale, where 1 = I don’t think this would be helpful and 7 = I
think this would be very helpful. Choose at least three mo4va4onal techniques to help you
focus on overcoming your depression, and remind yourself of these techniques at the start of
each day.
_____1. Schedule your assignments.
Pick a 4me each day to work on a therapy assignment. Write it down, just like you would
any important appointment and do your best to do this work at the appointed 4me. Try
and work on overcoming your depression every day!
_____2. Reward yourself when you are done with an assignment.
You already know that people (or animals) will be more likely to do something when
they experience a reward immediately a^er doing something new or difficult. Think of
some ways you can reward yourself a^er you do something that helps you overcome
your depression.
_____3. Sign a contract and commit to it.
Contracts are surprisingly helpful when it comes to making changes in your life. See page
56 for a contract you can sign to help you achieve your goals.
_____4. Share what you are doing with people you know.
One of the most effec4ve mo4vators for change is to tell a select group of friends and
family about what you are trying to do. You don’t have to confide everything about your
problem if you don’t want to, but just let these people know that you are working on a
specific aspect of your life and ask for their support. It goes without saying that you
should only ask for support from people who can give it to you. Use the ac4vity Building
Your Support System (page 88) to help you iden4fy people who can help you overcome
your depression.
6
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
_____5. Set a goal.
Set a tangible behavior goal for yourself. You might also wish to iden4fy the sub-goals or
steps you need to take to achieve your main goal. See page 50 for a worksheet to help
you determine the steps you need to take to achieve your goal.
_____6. Track your progress.
Most of the exercises in this book include a chart to help you keep track of your efforts in
overcoming your depression. Recording your progress every day is essen4al to keeping
you mo4vated, even when change seems difficult to achieve.
_____7. Set your inten4on.
Many coaches and therapists encourage people to “set their inten4on” at the beginning
of each day, preferably before medita4ng. Deepak Chopra, best-selling spiritual writer,
notes: “The sages of India observed thousands of years ago that our destiny is
ultimately shaped by our deepest intentions and desires. An intention is a directed
impulse of consciousness that contains the seed form of that which you aim to
create.”
_____8. Adopt a compassionate abtude toward your efforts.
Being self-cri4cal and perfec4onis4c will likely get in the way of your efforts to change.
You will have setbacks and even reversals, for that is only human. You can learn to be a
good “parent” to yourself as you change. A good parent guides and encourages a child
toward a goal, always believing that the goal can be achieved, but also being
compassionate and loving. See page 62 to learn about self-compassion.
_____9. Act like your heroes.
Inspira4on is an important aspect of mo4va4on. Think about someone who has inspired
you because he/she has overcome an almost insurmountable problem. Take a moment
during the day to imagine what that person would say to you to encourage your efforts
to conquer your problem.
_____10. Look for progress each day.
Focus on the small posi4ve changes that you make in your life each day, rather than on
the things that are causing you problems. Even when 4mes are difficult, you can do
things each day that will help you lead a happier and fulfilling life.

INCREASING POSITIVE FEELINGS
Three Good Things That Happened Today
When it comes to overcoming depression, studies suggest that even small changes in your daily
life can have profound effects.
For example, Dr. Mar4n Seligman, working at the University of Pennsylvania, asked a group of
extremely depressed people to simply write down three good things that happened to them
each day. He explained that these good things could be very small events, like feeling the warm
sunshine on your face, calling a friend, or just watching a favorite TV show. Seligman discovered
that within fi^een days, 94 percent of the people in the study reported that they experienced
some relief from their symptoms.
If you are suffering from depression, this exercise can likely help you, too. Just make copies of
this worksheet and use it at the end of each day for a minimum of three weeks.
Today’s date _____
One good thing that happened today …

Imagining Your Best Possible Self
This exercise has been used in many studies to show how visualizing and wri4ng about a
posi4ve future can improve your mood. There are five worksheets to be used on five successive
days.
Before you begin each worksheet, sit back and relax, and take a few deep breaths. Clear your
mind of all the things that have bothered you or worried you during the day.
Take about ten minutes to write on each worksheet. Don’t worry about your grammar or your
spelling; just write about whatever comes to mind. Be posi4ve, but also be realis4c. For
example, rather than imagining that you won the loZery and you are living in a luxurious
mansion on a private island, you could imagine that you have been successful in your career and
you have a life where you can enjoy the things you like to do without worry.
Day 1
Imagine the best possible family life you could have in five years. Think about your actual
rela4ves, but also friends who are as close as family. Perhaps you live close to your parents.
Perhaps your children are grown and yet are s4ll close to you. Perhaps you spend a great deal of
4me with people you care about. Be realis4c, but imagine all the possible ways you could enjoy
your family and close friends.

Finding Awe
Awe is the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our understanding
of the world. Scien4sts tell us that awe, even more than other posi4ve emo4ons, increases our
sense of happiness and fulfillment by making us feel that we are connected to others around us.
Some research even suggests that a daily dose of awe will make us more resilient and boost our
immune system.
Use this worksheet to bring more awe into your life.

Name three things in nature that always bring you a sense of awe.

Crea4ng a Personal Mission Statement
If you want to live each day to the fullest, you will need to think about what you really want out
of your life and the principles and values that will guide your day-to-day decisions. This
worksheet is designed to help you create a personal mission statement (some4mes called a
“purpose statement”), which can be a simple road map to help you live a happy and fulfilling
life.
A personal mission statement provides clarity and gives you a sense of purpose. It defines who
you are and how you will live.
A personal mission statement is different from the goals you have for yourself. In fact, it is what
your goals are based on. A personal mission statement includes your values, beliefs, and
priori4es in just a sentence or two. A personal mission statement will not only show you the
path to make your decisions each day, it will also give you permission to say “no” to the things
in your life that are not really important to you.
It is important to note that a personal mission statement is not wriZen in stone, but rather it
will change over 4me as your life experiences change. Your personal mission statement should
be focused on self-discovery as well as purpose.
Here are some personal mission statements from some people you may know:
“To be a teacher. And to be known for inspiring my students to be more than they
thought they could be.”
– Oprah Winfrey
“To have fun in [my] journey through life and learn from [my] mistakes.”
– Sir Richard Branson
“My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some
passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.”
– Maya Angelou

Iden4fying Your Signature Strengths
Research in the area of posi4ve psychology suggests that an important way to achieve
greater happiness is to understand and prac4ce your signature strengths (also called
“character strengths”). Review the list of strengths below and rate each strength on the
following scale:
0 = This doesn’t describe me.
1 = I exhibit this strength occasionally.
2 = I exhibit this strength o^en.

Things You Can Do To Li^ Your Spirits
Most people who are depressed cut back on their ac4vi4es, even the ones they used to enjoy.
Not surprisingly, when you stop doing things that give you pleasure, then your mood gets even
worse and life’s burdens take on more importance.
However, you can reverse this downward cycle when you commit to doing pleasurable ac4vi4es
each day. Make a list of five ac4vi4es you can do to li^ your spirits and have a more posi4ve
mood throughout the day. Try to do at least one of the ac4vi4es each day for a week, ra4ng
your mood from 1 to 10 immediately a^er each ac4vity, where 1 = sad or feeling empty and 10
= happy and energized. If you can commit to doing more pleasurable ac4vi4es each day, you will
likely make faster progress in overcoming your depression.

Crea4ng a Gra4tude Journal
Researchers who study why some people are happier than others consistently find that
adop4ng a daily “abtude of gra4tude” li^s our spirits and acts as a barrier to the small and
large things that would normally upset us. People who are consistently grateful have been
found to be happier, more energe4c, more hopeful, and report more frequent posi4ve
emo4ons.
Being grateful is more than just saying “thank you.” Robert Emmons, a prominent researcher on
how gra4tude affects our lives, describes gra4tude as “a felt sense of wonder, thankfulness, and
apprecia4on for life.”
Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a professor at the University of California and author of The How of
Happiness, notes that gra4tude has many benefits in our daily lives, focusing us on posi4ve
experiences, helping us be more connected to others, and increasing our sa4sfac4on with life.
Use the “Daily Gra4tude Calendar” to record something you are grateful for each day. Don’t
repeat yourself, but rather look for something new to be grateful for as soon as you wake up.
“Cul4vate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you, and to give thanks
con4nuously. And because all things have contributed to your advancement, you should include
all things in your gra4tude.”
– Ralph Waldo Emerson

Feeling BeZer Through Spiritual Awareness
Broadly speaking, spirituality is the meaning that people seek in their lives through connec4on
with a higher power. While formal religion can certainly provide a sense of spirituality, many
people seek to bring spirituality into their lives outside their religion.
Research tells us that becoming more spiritual may be par4cularly helpful for people with
emo4onal problems, helping them deal with a variety of life’s challenges. This makes sense
because spirituality emphasizes the importance of a posi4ve outlook, reflec4on on one’s goals
and purpose, and seeking inner strength and peace in the context of living a value-based life.
This worksheet is designed to help you iden4fy spiritual prac4ces to help you through difficult
4mes and also to enrich your day-to-day life. Although you may feel beZer from the very first
4me you try one of these prac4ces, it is worth no4ng that bringing spirituality into your life is a
long-term commitment and you will see the most important changes to your emo4onal wellbeing over 4me.
Look at the list of spiritual prac4ces below and check off the ones you think would be most
helpful. Then answer the ques4ons for each of the prac4ces you have checked to help you
commit to one or more of these prac4ces. Add other prac4ces you would like to try.
_____Spending 4me apprecia4ng nature (e.g., taking a walk in the woods or by the beach)
_____Medita4on
_____Prayer
_____Community service
_____Keeping a journal
_____Reading books about spirituality
_____Yoga

Finding Joy and Balance in Your Life
The G.L.A.D. technique was developed by Donald Altman as a par4cularly useful approach to
developing a posi4ve abtude toward life (see The Mindfulness Toolbox, New Harbinger
Publica4ons). It is designed to help people pay aZen4on to posi4ve things that are around them
all of the 4me but that frequently go unno4ced.
While some people may want to fill in the G.L.A.D. worksheet throughout the day, it is more
prac4cal to fill it out at the end of the day. Make copies of this worksheet so that you can
prac4ce the technique every day for at least three weeks. A^er three weeks, your “posi4ve
mindfulness” will become a habit. A^er three weeks, you might want to use the worksheet just
once a week, but you should s4ll do it on a regular schedule (for example every Sunday night).
Developing “posi4ve mindfulness” is par4cularly important for people who are stressed and
depressed, but it should also be considered a resiliency tool which can help you find daily
happiness in your life.
Keep your worksheets together and look at them from 4me to 4me. You may also want to share
the posi4ve experiences you write down on your worksheet with others. Sharing your posi4ve
thoughts and feelings makes them even more important.

Loving Kindness Medita4on
The “loving kindness medita4on” is a simple exercise in which you recite posi4ve thoughts
about yourself and others. Saying this medita4on aloud can immediately improve your mood
because it focuses you on the posi4ve things in your life and your sense of purpose. The effects
of this prac4ce can also be surprisingly long las4ng. Studies show that the regular prac4ce of
this medita4on can increase your resiliency and bring you a sense of fulfillment you may have
never thought possible.
This medita4on has five simple steps. It begins by invi4ng you to express posi4ve thoughts
about yourself, followed by posi4ve thoughts of someone you care about. Then it requires
something you may not have done before: you send out posi4ve thoughts toward someone you
feel neutral about, followed by posi4ve thoughts toward someone you dislike. Then you direct
your posi4ve thoughts out to the universe.
This medita4on takes just a few minutes, but it goes a long way to opening up your posi4ve
emo4ons and lebng go of your nega4ve judgments.
Here’s how to do it:
1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed.
2. Imagine yourself in a place where you feel complete sa4sfac4on and have an allencompassing sense of well-being. Perhaps you are sibng on a beach at sunset with the
warm glow of the sun s4ll on your skin. Perhaps you are in your own living room,
surrounded by people who love you. Think of a place that makes you unspeakably happy.
3. Now say the following phrases out loud.
38
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
I wish for happiness, calm, and peace for myself.
Now visualize someone you care about and say:
I wish for happiness, calm, and peace for you.
Now visualize someone you feel neutral about—
someone you neither like nor dislike—and say:
I wish for happiness, calm, and peace for you.
Now think of someone you don’t like and say:
I wish you happiness, calm, and peace.
Finally, direct your loving kindness to the universe and say:
May all beings everywhere find happiness and peace.

Using Coping Statements to Talk Back to Your Depression
Accep4ng your thoughts and feelings can help you move past your difficul4es. Taking a posi4ve
“solu4on-focused” view of your life can s4mulate a posi4ve and op4mis4c way of viewing your
life. Look at the statements below and put a check by the statements that ring true for you.
_____I can’t change what has already happened.
_____I’m not going to drive myself crazy with things I can’t change.
_____Dwelling on the past keeps me from apprecia4ng what is in the present.
_____I can accept things the way they are.
_____This feels bad, but it is a normal reac4on and will pass.
_____I have dealt with problems before and I can deal with this.
_____Thoughts are just happening in my brain; they are not THE TRUTH.
_____I can learn from the past to solve present and future problems.
_____I can get through this.
_____This is difficult, but it is temporary.
_____If I stop and calm myself down, then I can get through this.
_____These are just feelings and will go away.
_____I can feel badly but s4ll act in ways that are good for me and good for others.
_____I don’t need to change everything at once.
_____I can accept myself the way I am.
_____I can accept my situa4on for what it is and s4ll be happy.
_____It’s okay to feel this way.

Identifying Your Automatic and Irrational Thoughts
Psychologists believe that people who are depressed have certain kinds of automa4c and
irra4onal thoughts that distort their view of themselves and their world. These thoughts are
“irra4onal” because they are not based on any facts; however, depressed people s4ll act as if
they are true. Recognizing your automa4c thoughts and replacing them with ra4onal ones can
be an important part of overcoming your depression.
First, think about these different kinds of automa4c and irra4onal thoughts below and see if you
can give an example of when you have this type of irra4onal thought.
Discoun4ng
You insist that your accomplishments or posi4ve quali4es “don’t count.”

Giving Up Nega4ve Judgments About Others
Many people have a difficult 4me rela4ng to others without being highly judgmental. Some
people divide the world into “good” and “bad” with no room to see that the people around
them have many different quali4es. Other people are overly cri4cal. They focus most of their
energy on the things people do that they think are wrong, and so they are o^en angry, unhappy,
and lonely.
Examples of Nega4ve Judgments
Do any of these thoughts sound like ones you have? Fill in the blanks below.
• My _____________________ is so mean, I can’t stand to be with her.
• _____________________ is not a good friend, because I keep invi4ng her out but she never
invites me to go with her.
• _____________________ is incompetent and my work is miserable.
• My _____________________ thinks about everyone but me.
• My _____________________ is really a loser. No wonder he/she is having problems.
Write down three nega4ve judgments that you have had recently.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________________
If you are prone to nega4vely judging others, it is probably detrac4ng from your own happiness
and life sa4sfac4on. This worksheet can help. You don’t have to “change” the way you think or
feel, but rather just observe and acknowledge your nega4ve and cri4cal thoughts as if they were
clouds floa4ng by in the sky. In other words, don’t react to these thoughts with any par4cular
emo4on; just let them come and go.
Use the chart on the next page to keep track of all your nega4ve judgments about the people in
your life for three days.

Solving Your Problems One Step at a Time
One of the most serious symptoms of depression is the belief that your problems are beyond
your control and will never get beZer. But most problems can be addressed by sebng a realis4c
goal and determining the steps necessary to achieve that goal.
For example, Diane was depressed because she felt overwhelmed by the stress in her life and
she had very few things that made her happy. Diane lived with her elderly mother, who had
several serious illnesses. Diane felt that she had no 4me for herself and no social life. Diane
didn’t like her job as a warehouse manager, but it paid well and she needed the money, and she
didn’t feel that she had the 4me or energy to find a more fulfilling job.
Diane began the process of improving her life by lis4ng her two main goals:
• To engage in more social ac4vi4es and meet new people
• To find a more interes4ng job that paid as least as much as her old job
Diane felt that the first goal was easier to achieve and would help her feel beZer about her life
more quickly.
She began by wri4ng a goal that was achievable and measurable. It is important to have a goal
that is measurable so you can know what to work toward and to be clear when your goal has
been accomplished. Diane’s goal was: “to go out and meet new people at least once a week.”
Diane broke her goal into small steps or sub-goals. They were:
1. To make a list of ac4vity groups in her area by doing research on the Internet
2. To decide on three ac4vity groups that she would enjoy
3. To find several people who would stay with her mother when she was out
4. To go out to an ac4vity once a week (even if she wasn’t in the mood)
Within a month, Diane had found a knibng group that met every Friday night at a local
Starbucks. Through the group, she made a few friends and began to feel less isolated in her life.
Of course, not every journey to solving a problem is so straighxorward. Some4mes you have to
change the steps you must take to achieve a goal. Some4mes there are unforeseen obstacles,
and many 4mes mo4va4on is a problem. Let’s face it, change is hard. But sebng a goal and
wri4ng down the steps to achieve your goal is an important part of the process of crea4ng a
happier and more fulfilling life.

Developing Your Nurturing Inner Voice
Many people have an internal voice that is constantly cri4cizing them and aZacking their selfworth. If this is true for you, this voice may have originated with a parent, a teacher, or another
overly cri4cal adult in your childhood. It may be a mixture of harsh comments you heard when
you were growing up. You may not even remember just where or when the cri4cizing voice in
your head appeared, but it is important to know that you don’t have to listen to it anymore.
Instead of listening to the cri4cal voices in your head, you can develop a nurturing inner voice
that you can listen to when you are feeling low and you are ques4oning your self-worth.
Begin by wri4ng down five nurturing statements that you want to hear. These are the kind of
statements that someone who cares deeply about you might say to you.
Some examples might be:
I’m really proud of what you have accomplished.
You always amaze me.
You should give yourself more credit for all that you do.
Now write in things you’d like to hear.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Now think of someone you consider to be very nurturing. It can be someone you know or it can
be someone you don’t know well at all but you think of as a nurturing person. It could even be
someone from fic4on or someone you made up in your mind.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
54
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
Now imagine that this person is saying any or all of the above statements to you. Describe the
situa4on (room, clothing, body posi4on) you are in.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Think about this scene un4l it is very vivid in your mind. What else is this person saying to you
or doing that makes you feel cared for?
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
What are you saying back?
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Now change the channel to your cri4cal voice, just for a moment. Imagine that your cri4cal
voice is back talking to you in your head. What is it saying?

NEW WAYS TO THINK
Using a Contract to Commit to Change
Behavioral contracts are not just for kids. In fact, creating a behavioral contract and sharing it
with others is one of the most effective ways for adults to motivate themselves to make changes
in their lives. Use the contract below to commit yourself to changes that will help you overcome
your depression or any other problem that is holding you back in your life.

Acts of Kindness Lead to Happiness
Researchers tell us that being kind will not just benefit people you help but can also make you
happy, too, and can li^ your mood on a permanent basis. According to research by Dr. Sonja
Lyubomirsky, author of The How of Happiness, kindness can start a chain of posi4ve social
consequences, bringing you closer to others and helping you appreciate the most posi4ve
aspects of human nature.
The Random Acts of Kindness movement advocates thoughxul and considerate acts as a way of
life, but research actually shows that the “happiness benefits” of acts of kindness are greatest
when you consciously decide to do a kind act just one day a week. On that day, you should seek
to do a significant act of kindness, for example, not just holding the door for someone but
perhaps taking the 4me to write a note of apprecia4on to someone important in your life.
Use this worksheet to plan and then record your weekly act of kindness.

Increasing Flow Experiences
In psychological terms, “flow” is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in a feeling
of energized focus while performing a challenging ac4vity. People more commonly call this
“being in the zone.” Many psychologists feel that when people have frequent experiences of
“flow,” preferably several 4mes a day, they experience more posi4ve emo4ons, as well as a
sense of well-being and purpose.
Flow is a feeling in which even difficult tasks become easy. You lose track of 4me because you
are so involved in the ac4vity. Runners o^en talk about a “runner’s high,” when running even
long distances becomes almost effortless. Some people experience flow while doing a hobby,
like gardening or restoring their car. Some people are lucky enough to experience flow doing
their work.
Sonja Lyubomirsky, in her book The How of Happiness, writes, “The experience of flow leads us
to be involved in life (rather than be alienated from it), to enjoy ac4vi4es (rather than to find
them dreary), to have a sense of control (rather than helplessness), and to feel a strong sense of
self (rather than unworthiness). All these factors imbue life with meaning and lend it a richness
and intensity. And happiness.”
You will know you are experiencing a flow ac4vity when:
1. You’re completely involved in what you’re doing; you’re completely focused on what
you’re doing.
2. There’s a sense of great pleasure as you perform a flow task; you feel outside of
everyday reality.
3. There’s a sense of inner clarity; you know what needs to be done and you get immediate
feedback on how well you’re doing.
4. You know that the ac4vity is doable, even though it may be difficult; you’re confident
that you have the necessary skills to complete the task successfully.
5. You lose your sense of self, and your worries and concerns dri^ away.
6. You lose track of 4me, and you’re completely focused on the present moment.
7. There’s an intrinsic mo4va4on; whatever you’re doing to produce flow becomes its own
reward.
59
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
The feelings of flow are a “natural high” and, in fact, your brain does produce chemicals that
make you feel “high,” including endorphins and endocannabinoids, which are a naturally
synthesized version of THC. This is the chemical responsible for the buzz that marijuana
produces.
This worksheet will examine how you can have more periods of flow in your life.
Use this sheet to think about the ac4vi4es that create flow. Then, use the chart on the next
page to record your success at crea4ng flow ac4vi4es each day.

Prac4cing Compassionate Self-Care
People who are depressed are typically very hard on themselves. They may feel and act like
their depression is their fault or that they are somehow “flawed.” Many people suffering from
depression feel that their past ac4ons and choices are the reasons for their depression and they
have an internal dialogue that keeps them feeling low.
If this sounds like you, then you know that this type of abtude and behavior is no help at all.
Rather than being hard on yourself, you can prac4ce compassionate self-care. You can treat
yourself with understanding and kindness, just the way you would treat a friend in need.
Prac4cing compassionate self-care is not being self-indulgent. Self-indulgence is when you give
yourself more than you need, like ea4ng two desserts or buying clothes when your closets are
already burs4ng. Compassionate self-care is also not self-pity. Self-pity is when you feel that
your problems are worse than the problems of everyone else. Compassionate self-care
recognizes the fact that all humans have problems and all humans make mistakes. And that
includes you!
In this worksheet, you should list all the ways you would treat a friend in need. Think of
someone you care about very much and imagine that he or she is having a very difficult 4me.

Overcoming Depression with the Help of Exercise
Regular exercise can help you overcome your anxiety in a number of ways. During exercise, your
brain increases the produc4on of chemicals that can li^ your mood and regulate your emo4ons.
With regular exercise, you will feel stronger and more confident and be more likely to feel that
you can make posi4ve changes in your life. Exercise will also increase the oxygen flow to your
brain, which may help you think more clearly, more ra4onally, and more posi4vely.

Gebng More Sleep Can Help Improve Your Mood
Do you have a hard 4me falling asleep or staying asleep? A lack of sleep will reduce the
serotonin levels in your brain, which may make it harder to control your moods during the day.
There are a variety of techniques that can help you get the sleep you need, but, of course, they
only work if you are diligent at trying them and then using the ones that work best. Gebng
enough sleep is an important part of your overall plan to overcome your depression and is also
important for your general health.
There are a variety of medica4ons available to help you sleep, including prescrip4on
medica4on, herbs, and supplements, but always consult a physician before taking any kind of
sleep aid.
Here are some other things you can try. On the chart on the next page, keep track of your sleep
and the methods you use to sleep beZer. Track your progress for at least two weeks.
Techniques to Help You Get More Sleep
• Listen to so^ music, read, take a warm shower, or meditate before going to bed.
• Exercise for at least a half-hour each day, but not before you go to bed.
• Write a to-do list for the following day and then clear your head of those concerns.
• Prac4ce deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxa4on before bed4me.
• Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nico4ne, either en4rely or at least in the evenings.
• Keep your bedroom at a cool temperature (65–68 degrees).
• If you are sensi4ve to light and sound, wear earplugs and a sleep mask or try a white-noise
machine to mask the sound. There are various white-noise apps available if you have a
smartphone.
• If you are having trouble falling asleep, get out of bed and do some light ac4vity (like reading) in
another room. Go back to bed when you feel drowsy.
• Go to bed and get up at the same 4me every day.
• Avoid ea4ng heavy meals for at least two to three hours before bed.
• Make sure your maZress and pillows are comfortable.
• Write down other ideas to help you get more sleep.

Diet, stress, and mood are all intertwined, so it’s important to consider what you’re pubng in
your body, not only for your physical health but also for your emo4onal well-being.
It is not necessary to go to extremes in changing your diet. By simply being more mindful of
what you’re pubng in your body, you can find small ways to improve, and that can add up to big
changes.
The following are some of the substances that can affect your depression:
• Caffeine: You’ll find this s4mulant in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, energy drinks, and some
over-the-counter medica4ons. The temporary boost it provides can end in fa4gue,
headache, and tension. Caffeine has also been iden4fied as a poten4al trigger for anxiety
aZacks and a contributor to other health issues such as insomnia, heartburn, aggression,
irritability, heart palpita4ons, and high blood pressure.
• Salt: Sodium is present in many processed foods, so check labels and look for low-sodium
or salt-free alterna4ves. Also, be aware of how much salt you use while cooking. Sodium
consump4on affects fluid reten4on, weight, and blood pressure, all of which, in turn, can
affect your mood.
• Sugar: Excessive intake of simple sugars (such as white or brown sugar and honey) can
cause health problems such as diabetes and hypoglycemia. Also, the temporary upli^ing
effects come with some other serious downsides, including an increased risk of depression
in those who have a sugar-heavy diet.
• Preserva4ves and hormones: These substances are present in processed foods and many
types of meats. Our bodies were not built to handle these addi4ves, and their possible
side effects have been heavily debated. Swapping in some whole, unprocessed, organic
foods can help reduce consump4on of these poten4ally harmful substances.
• Nico4ne and alcohol: Introducing these substances into your system can cause a range of
problems, not the least of which is aggrava4ng anxiety. Nico4ne is a s4mulant, like
caffeine, and alcohol a depressant. The addic4ve proper4es of both nico4ne and alcohol
have also been well documented.
It should also be men4oned that what you don’t put in your body can also be problema4c.
Nutrient deficiencies and dehydra4on can cause irritability, anxiety, and fa4gue. So stop
skipping meals and make sure you are drinking enough water.

COPING WITH STRESS AND DIFFICULT FEELINGS
Breaking the Cycle of Stress and Depression
Dealing with your stress in a construc4ve way can be an important part of overcoming your
depression. Of course, not all stress is bad. A small amount of stress is actually good for you,
keeping you alert and mo4vated. But sustained stress will elevate stress biochemicals such as
cor4sol, which can take a toll on your mood and your body. Over 4me, cor4sol can also weaken
your immune system and even affect your memory.
Sustained stress also interferes with “happiness biochemicals” such as serotonin and dopamine.
These are biochemicals produced in the brain and body that translate into feelings of calm,
happiness, and well-being. They are the same biochemicals that are affected when you take
an4-depressant medica4on.
The connec4on between stress and depression is complex and circular. Besides the direct
impact on your body and mood, excess stress can lead to poor habits like drinking and
overea4ng, which will then exacerbate your feelings of depression.
Fortunately, you have it in your power to break the cycle of stress and depression. Researchers
tell us that specific ac4vi4es can reduce the harmful biochemicals associated with prolonged
stress and elevate the biochemicals associated with feelings of sa4sfac4on and well-being.
This worksheet shows you things you can do every day to fight the nega4ve impact of stress on
your depression. When you make these ac4vi4es daily habits, they will not only help you
overcome your depression but will also help prevent physical problems.
Put a check mark by the ac4vi4es you are most likely to do. See if you can find one ac4vity to do
in each category. Then es4mate the 4me you will do the ac4vi4es each day. Finally, put a check
mark when you have accomplished this ac4vity each day in a week. Keep this chart for three
weeks.

Dealing with Shame and Guilt
Some4mes people become fixated on blaming themselves for certain situa4ons or events. They
blame themselves for something terrible that has happened as if they were the sole cause of a
par4cular misfortune. Yet it is very rare that a single person causes a complex event. People
who have suffered a trauma o^en feel shame and guilt, even when they had no part in causing
the trauma and may have even been a vic4m.
This worksheet is designed to help you reduce your shame and guilt by thinking about the many
factors that might have caused a par4cular event.
Describe a situa4on where you blamed yourself.

Gebng Through Difficult Times with Mindfulness
As you may know, mindfulness is a technique that Western psychology has borrowed from the
Buddhist tradi4on of Mindful Medita4on. Mindfulness involves bringing your aZen4on to what
is happening in the present moment. When you are “mindful,” you are aware of both your
internal experiences as well as what you experience in the world around you. As you observe
your internal and external experiences, you try not to judge them as good or bad, or even react
to them at all. When you are mindful, you are aware and present in the moment.
Does this sound simple? It might be a liZle harder than you think. But prac4cing mindfulness is
well worth the effort as it has proven to be very helpful in overcoming depression. Mindfulness
helps you be aware of your nega4ve thoughts and feelings, without judging them. As you
prac4ce mindfulness, your nega4ve thoughts and feelings eventually make them less powerful.
Many studies have also shown that there are measurable health benefits when you prac4ce
mindfulness on a regular basis. These include boos4ng the immune system, improving memory,
and increasing your ability to focus.
There are two main types of mindfulness. The first is called Mindful Medita4on and refers to
sebng aside some 4me each day to prac4ce mindfulness. There are many books and audio
resources to help you learn Mindful Medita4on. Here is an example of Mindful Medita4on from
Dartmouth College Health Center. hZps://www.betweensessions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/
Mindful-Medita4on.mp3.
The second type of mindfulness occurs in everyday life and involves prac4cing mindful
awareness in everyday ac4vi4es. You prac4ce mindfulness while you are walking, while you are
ea4ng, even while you are doing a chore like sweeping the floor. All you have to do is be aware
of your inner and outer experiences without trying to judge them or change them. You can use
the worksheet on the next page to record prac4cing mindfulness at least once a day.

Accepting Unpleasant Experiences, Thoughts, and Feelings
We use language to define our experiences, including those that have caused unpleasant
feelings. By labeling experiences nega4vely, we create the tendency to limit, avoid, or control
situa4ons so that the discomfort associated with them will not be repeated. When you are
depressed, you may be avoiding experiences just because they have a nega4ve associa4on, but
avoiding these situa4ons may be restric4ng your life and keeping you more depressed.
This worksheet will act as a guide to help you understand that your experience of the present
moment does not have to be determined by the past. Accep4ng unpleasant internal
experiences, rather than ac4vely avoiding them, creates opportuni4es for posi4ve and
rewarding experiences that you might otherwise have missed.
Iden4fy five nega4ve internal experiences that cause you to severely limit, avoid, or control
certain ac4vi4es (for example, anxiety, worry, sadness, jealousy, fear, insecurity, etc.):

CONNECTING TO OTHERS
Communica4ng Your Needs and Feelings with “I”
Statements
Some4mes people don’t tell others how they feel, which can lead to a variety of frustra4ng
problems. It helps when you prac4ce using “I” statements, like the ones on this worksheet.
“I” statements are a method of saying precisely how you feel and what you want others to
understand. Using “I” statements doesn’t mean that you’ll get everything you want, but at
least people will understand what is important to you. This worksheet will help you think
about making your feelings clearer to specific people. Fill it in with different people in mind,
and then prac4ce using similar statements in real-life situa4ons.
Perhaps someone in your life could also benefit from making clear “I” statements? You
should also consider giving this worksheet to people who might benefit from communica4ng
their needs more effec4vely.
Fill in these “I” statements with a par4cular person in mind:
Name of person:__________________________________________________________
I feel because______________________________________________.
I would like it if you would__________________________________________________.
I really want_____________________________________________________________.
I hope you understand that_________________________________________________.

Don’t Be Alone
Humans are social animals, and our gene4c makeup predisposes us to want to seek the
company of others. But, like most gene4c character traits, there appears to be a significant
varia4on in how much individuals desire to be social. Some people say they can’t stand to be
alone for even a few hours. Others say they prefer to be alone much of the 4me. But, despite
the varia4on in the desire for social contact, from a psychological perspec4ve, social isola4on
can be a big problem, par4cularly during 4mes of emo4onal stress. Ideally, people should have
at least several close friends, as well as a group of people who make them feel they are
connected to a community. A close-knit family, of course, is also important.
If you find yourself being alone much of the 4me—even if it “feels” okay to you—you should
consider increasing your social contact. Take a look at the social ac4vi4es listed below. When
you get up each morning, think about at least one social ac4vity you can do each day.
Note: Internet-based social ac4vi4es like social media and email are helpful but they do not
replace real-life contact with people.
Social Ac9vi9es Checklist
(Choose at least one to do each day)
_____Have dinner with a friend.
_____AZend a Meetup (go to Meetup.com for groups in your area).
_____Take a walk with a friend.
_____AZend a community service group (Rotary Club, Kiwanis, and so on).
_____Reconnect with friends and family. List two or three people who come to mind:
 _____________________ _____________________ _____________________
_____AZend a spiritual or religious group.
_____Go on a nature-related ac4vity (e.g., hiking, bird watching, travel).
_____AZend a hobby- or cra^-related group (e.g., knibng, photography, etc.).
_____AZend a course.
_____AZend a community or poli4cal mee4ng.
_____AZend a support group.
_____Volunteer to help others.
_____AZend local lectures at the library.

Building Your Support System
It will be much easier to overcome your problems with the support of others. Some people feel
that one person, like a spouse or significant other, should provide all the support they need, but
developing a support network is preferred.
This worksheet can help you think about people who can support you in various areas of your
life. If you have difficulty thinking of people, think of people who could possibly fill this role, and
then work toward making this happen. O^en, you’ll find you can get the support you need by
just asking for it.
Write down at least one person you know who fits into each category.
Someone I can discuss a personal problem with:

How Do You Want to Be Treated?
When you are working to overcome a psychological problem, you will almost always make more
progress when you reach out to others. But will your friends and family provide you with the

clear about what you want and what you don’t want. Use this worksheet to think about the
ways you want to be supported, and make sure that you communicate this clearly to the
important people around you. You can even show them this worksheet to get the conversa4on
started.
What I don’t want from others:
_____ To be blamed for something I cannot help
_____ To be told to just “get over it”
_____ To be told to just “cheer up”
_____ To be told “other people have it much worse than you”

CREATING A PERMANENT CHANGE
What Has Helped You?
Personal change can be a long and some4mes unexpected process. You can find solu4ons to
your problems and conflicts from sudden insight or by following a carefully cra^ed plan. You can
find help from working with your therapist and also from books, friends, and things you see on
the Internet and social media, and much more.
Whatever your process of discovering solu4ons to your problems and conflicts, wri4ng down
what you have learned will be an important part of making las4ng changes.
This worksheet is designed to help you think about what has helped you along your journey to
overcome your problems. Take some 4me, at least once a month, to fill in the worksheet. You
will likely find added benefit from sharing it with your therapist or a close friend. Of course, you
can also use this worksheet more frequently. Using it more frequently may be helpful in 4mes of
stress and during difficult life transi4ons.

Overcoming Setbacks
Overcoming depression takes a lot of work, and you may experience setbacks for a variety of
reasons. Don’t be upset if you have a setback in dealing with your depression. Setbacks are
common because stress and change in your life are constant. And don’t let setbacks give you
the feeling that you are back to where you started. Setbacks are temporary, just a sign that you
need to pay aZen4on to the kind of life you want to live every day.
The easiest way to avoid setbacks is to prepare for them. Filling out this worksheet will help you
think about the kinds of things that can cause a setback and recognize the early signs that your
depression may be recurring. Answer these ques4ons thoroughly and honestly.

Keeping Track of How Medica4on Affects Your Depression
Many people decide to take medica4on to help with their depression, but they are o^en under
the misconcep4on that this will provide quick relief. In fact, while there have been many
advances in psychopharmacology, finding the right medica4on to help you with your depression
will almost always take some 4me.
There are different types of medica4ons that help with depression and the anxiety that
frequently accompanies it. O^en, medica4ons are used in combina4on, and it takes 4me and
pa4ence to figure exactly which combina4on of medica4ons will work best for you.
Unfortunately, there is no simple formula that will guide a physician to give you the exact
medica4on that will help you with your depression.
Keeping track of how you feel and func4on is really the only way for your prescribing physician
to know which medica4ons will help your depression. Use this worksheet to keep track of your
prescrip4on and non-prescrip4on medica4on, and bring it with you whenever you consult a
medical doctor.
It is important to remember that depression can also be a side effect of medica4ons that you
take for other purposes. Oral contracep4ves, drugs that treat high blood pressure, drugs that
treat high cholesterol, and even certain medica4ons that treat acne can trigger a depressed
mood. Always consult with your physician and pharmacist about the side effects of your
prescrip4on and non-prescrip4on medica4on and ask how they can possibly affect your mood.
Keeping Track of Your Medica4on
Use this sheet to keep track of how your medica4on affects you, and share it with your
prescribing physician.

Introduc4on
Overcoming Depression
Depression is o^en called the “common cold” of mental health problems. Almost all of us
experience at least a mild depression from 4me to 4me and an es4mated one-third of adults
will experience a significant depression in their life4me.
There are many types of depression. A person with Persistent Depressive Disorder will be
depressed for at least two years and will have episodes of major depression mixed with less
severe symptoms. Seasonal Affec4ve Disorder comes during the winter months when there is
less sunlight and is usually alleviated in the spring, but its impact during the winter months
cannot be underes4mated. Bipolar Disorder is characterized by depression combined with
periodic highs, which can include feelings of euphoria and also irritability. Depression is
frequently found with other problems as well, including addic4ons, marital problems, and workrelated stress.
If you are depressed, your diagnosis will depend on how many symptoms you are experiencing
and how long they last. Symptoms of depression include:
• Depressed mood, sadness, or an “empty” feeling
• Loss of interest or pleasure in ac4vi4es you once enjoyed
• Significant weight loss when not die4ng or significant weight gain
• Inability to sleep or excessive sleeping
• Restlessness or irrita4on
• Fa4gue or loss of energy
• Feelings of worthlessness, or excessive or inappropriate guilt
• Difficulty thinking or concentra4ng or indecisiveness
• Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide* with or without a specific plan
*Important: If you are thinking about suicide, even if it is only once in a while, call the Na4onal
Suicide Preven4on Lifeline immediately. Their counselors are available 24/7/365 with
confiden4al help and they will connect you to a network of services across the country. Call
1-800-273-8255 or visit their website hZps://suicidepreven4onlifeline.org/.

What This Workbook Can Do for You
This workbook is designed to be used as part of your treatment with a psychotherapist or
counselor. While you might find the worksheets are helpful at relieving your depression without
addi4onal help, seeing a qualified therapist or counselor will help you make much quicker
progress in overcoming your depression. Depression can be complicated and can o^en be
accompanied by other kinds of problems, such as anxiety disorders, which will need different
kinds of treatment. A professional therapist or counselor will help you focus on the things you
can do to get both immediate and long-term relief from your depression.
The standard treatment for depression involves teaching clients specific psychological skills to
stop the downward spiral of unhappiness, nega4vism, and self-defea4ng behaviors. The
worksheets in this book are based on the most recent thinking in Cogni4ve Behavioral Therapy,
which is considered to be the “gold standard” in the treatment of depression.
The skills and behaviors you will learn in this workbook can quite literally change the way your
brain works. We have hundreds of studies that show us that when people prac4ce certain
behaviors, the biochemicals in their brain change. These ac4vi4es can increase the biochemicals
that we associate with a sense of well-being, including serotonin (calmness and contentment),
oxytocin (love and connec4on to others), dopamine (pleasure), and endorphins (relaxa4on and
posi4ve feelings). As you prac4ce the exercises in this workbook, you will be ac4vely s4mula4ng
these important biochemicals.
Beyond Depression: Why Not Be Happy?
In the last twenty years, psychologists have started looking beyond just trea4ng the symptoms
of depression and have also focused their treatment on techniques that can help people find a
happier and more fulfilling life. Many of the worksheets in this workbook are derived from
research on why some people seem to be happier than others, and you may be surprised at
how liZle it takes to make this happen.
Researchers tell us that we all have a “set point” for happiness, a predisposi4on toward a
specific point on a con4nuum between being happy or depressed. In other words, you were
born with a predisposi4on toward a certain level of happiness, just as you were born with a
predisposi4on to be a certain weight. But like with your weight, your behavior can make a
difference in your happiness. When you learn to prac4ce a “diet” of behaviors that increase
happiness, you can defy your gene4c predisposi4on as well as your par4cular life circumstances.
It doesn’t maZer whether you are rich or poor, tall or short, married or single, you always have
it in your power to be happy.
How to Use This Workbook
The forty-four exercises in this workbook are organized into seven sec4ons.
ii
Understanding Your Depression
The worksheets in this sec4on will help you understand the reasons that you are depressed and
will help mo4vate you to change. Depression affects different people in different ways, and you
may have problems caused by your depression that you aZribute to other things in your life.
Understanding your depression will help you focus on the specific things you can do to feel
beZer sooner.
Increasing Posi9ve Feelings
The worksheets in this sec4on will focus you on ac4vi4es that can li^ your mood and develop
the “habit of happiness.” You may have been depressed for so long that you have forgoZen
what it feels like to be happy and have posi4ve feelings about yourself and others. Fortunately,
there are rela4vely simple ways to li^ your mood; once you incorporate these into your daily
life, you might start to feel happier in just a few weeks.
New Ways to Think
For nearly fi^y years we’ve known that changing the way you think can change the way that you
feel. The worksheets in this sec4on will help you understand how your irra4onal thinking can
make your depression worse, how giving up nega4ve judgments about others can make you feel
beZer about yourself, and how you can develop a more nurturing inner voice.
New Ways to Act
Overcoming depression takes work. But when you commit yourself to making daily changes in
your life, you can learn to control your emo4ons rather than having them control you. Some of
the changes that will help your depression involve basic lifestyle habits, like making sure you eat
nutri4ous meals and get enough sleep. Other ac4vi4es ask you to commit yourself to doing
things you enjoy and ac4ng with kindness and compassion toward others. You may be surprised
how liZle changes in your daily behavior can make a big difference in how you feel.
Coping with Stress and Difficult Feelings
Some4mes life is very hard. You might lose your job, get a divorce, or even suffer from the loss
of a loved one. There are many everyday things that can cause you to feel sadness and stress as
well, but these things don’t have to make you depressed. This sec4on teaches you techniques to
tolerate difficult 4mes and develop habits that will make you more resilient even when 4mes
are tough.
Connec9ng to Others
People who are depressed tend to isolate themselves and even hide their problems from those
who care about them. The worksheets in this sec4on will help you fight the ins4nct to “go it
alone” and help you realize that there are many people in your life who can help you in
overcoming your depression.
iii
Crea9ng a Permanent Change
Many people suffer from symptoms of depression throughout their life4me, but this can stop!
Of course, you will be sad and even unhappy at 4mes—that is all part of being human—but you
can learn to recognize when normal stresses and emo4ons turn into needless suffering. The
worksheets in this sec4on will help you iden4fy the things that have helped you overcome your
depression, help you recognize the things that can cause setbacks, and help you monitor any
medica4ons that you are taking for your depression.
There is no right or wrong place to start this workbook. All of the techniques in this book will be
helpful. If you are in therapy for your depression, you should discuss where to start with your
therapist or counselor. He or she might feel that there are some specific things you can do that
will have the most immediate impact.
Above all, is it is important to be pa4ent with yourself and persist in using these techniques
even though they may at 4mes be difficult. The treatment of depression, or any mental health
problem for that maZer, can quite literally change the way your brain works, but this can take
some 4me.
We wish you the best in working to overcome your depression. If you are looking for addi4onal
resources, we recommend using the website of the American Associa4on for Anxiety and
Depression, which can be found at hZps://www.adaa.org/.

When would you say you first started to have symptoms of depression?
What was going on in your life at that 4me?
Does Your Depression Physically Hurt?
Depression o^en hurts physically as well as emo4onally. That’s because the same biochemicals
that influence your mood also affect how your body interprets pain.
If you are experiencing any of the following health issues, it could be linked to your depression.
It is important to address these physical symptoms, along with your depression.
• Headaches (for those who experience migraines, these may be worse)
• Back pain
• Muscle aches and joint pain
• Diges4ve problems (nausea, stomachache, diarrhea, cons4pa4on)
• Exhaus4on and fa4gue (regardless of sleep)
• Sleeping problems (insomnia or oversleeping)
• Change in appe4te or weight
• Dizziness or lightheadedness
For the next week, keep track of any physical symptoms you experience, and rate each on a
scale of 1–5, with 5 being the worst.

Mo4va4ng Yourself to Change
Some of the most debilita4ng symptoms of depression are lethargy, hopelessness, and a sense
that things will never get beZer.
So how are you going to mo4vate yourself to do the assignments in this workbook? Let’s face it,
change is not easy. But research on mo4va4on tells us that there are many techniques that can
help. Read through the ten mo4va4on 4ps below and then go back and rate each as to whether
you think it would be helpful for you to use to make changes to overcome your depression. Rate
each technique on a seven-point scale, where 1 = I don’t think this would be helpful and 7 = I
think this would be very helpful. Choose at least three mo4va4onal techniques to help you
focus on overcoming your depression, and remind yourself of these techniques at the start of
each day.
_____1. Schedule your assignments.
Pick a 4me each day to work on a therapy assignment. Write it down, just like you would
any important appointment and do your best to do this work at the appointed 4me. Try
and work on overcoming your depression every day!
_____2. Reward yourself when you are done with an assignment.
You already know that people (or animals) will be more likely to do something when
they experience a reward immediately a^er doing something new or difficult. Think of
some ways you can reward yourself a^er you do something that helps you overcome
your depression.
_____3. Sign a contract and commit to it.
Contracts are surprisingly helpful when it comes to making changes in your life. See page
56 for a contract you can sign to help you achieve your goals.
_____4. Share what you are doing with people you know.
One of the most effec4ve mo4vators for change is to tell a select group of friends and
family about what you are trying to do. You don’t have to confide everything about your
problem if you don’t want to, but just let these people know that you are working on a
specific aspect of your life and ask for their support. It goes without saying that you
should only ask for support from people who can give it to you. Use the ac4vity Building
Your Support System (page 88) to help you iden4fy people who can help you overcome
your depression.
6
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
_____5. Set a goal.
Set a tangible behavior goal for yourself. You might also wish to iden4fy the sub-goals or
steps you need to take to achieve your main goal. See page 50 for a worksheet to help
you determine the steps you need to take to achieve your goal.
_____6. Track your progress.
Most of the exercises in this book include a chart to help you keep track of your efforts in
overcoming your depression. Recording your progress every day is essen4al to keeping
you mo4vated, even when change seems difficult to achieve.
_____7. Set your inten4on.
Many coaches and therapists encourage people to “set their inten4on” at the beginning
of each day, preferably before medita4ng. Deepak Chopra, best-selling spiritual writer,
notes: “The sages of India observed thousands of years ago that our destiny is
ultimately shaped by our deepest intentions and desires. An intention is a directed
impulse of consciousness that contains the seed form of that which you aim to
create.”
_____8. Adopt a compassionate abtude toward your efforts.
Being self-cri4cal and perfec4onis4c will likely get in the way of your efforts to change.
You will have setbacks and even reversals, for that is only human. You can learn to be a
good “parent” to yourself as you change. A good parent guides and encourages a child
toward a goal, always believing that the goal can be achieved, but also being
compassionate and loving. See page 62 to learn about self-compassion.
_____9. Act like your heroes.
Inspira4on is an important aspect of mo4va4on. Think about someone who has inspired
you because he/she has overcome an almost insurmountable problem. Take a moment
during the day to imagine what that person would say to you to encourage your efforts
to conquer your problem.
_____10. Look for progress each day.
Focus on the small posi4ve changes that you make in your life each day, rather than on
the things that are causing you problems. Even when 4mes are difficult, you can do
things each day that will help you lead a happier and fulfilling life.

INCREASING POSITIVE FEELINGS
Three Good Things That Happened Today
When it comes to overcoming depression, studies suggest that even small changes in your daily
life can have profound effects.
For example, Dr. Mar4n Seligman, working at the University of Pennsylvania, asked a group of
extremely depressed people to simply write down three good things that happened to them
each day. He explained that these good things could be very small events, like feeling the warm
sunshine on your face, calling a friend, or just watching a favorite TV show. Seligman discovered
that within fi^een days, 94 percent of the people in the study reported that they experienced
some relief from their symptoms.
If you are suffering from depression, this exercise can likely help you, too. Just make copies of
this worksheet and use it at the end of each day for a minimum of three weeks.

Imagining Your Best Possible Self
This exercise has been used in many studies to show how visualizing and wri4ng about a
posi4ve future can improve your mood. There are five worksheets to be used on five successive
days.
Before you begin each worksheet, sit back and relax, and take a few deep breaths. Clear your
mind of all the things that have bothered you or worried you during the day.
Take about ten minutes to write on each worksheet. Don’t worry about your grammar or your
spelling; just write about whatever comes to mind. Be posi4ve, but also be realis4c. For
example, rather than imagining that you won the loZery and you are living in a luxurious
mansion on a private island, you could imagine that you have been successful in your career and
you have a life where you can enjoy the things you like to do without worry.
Day 1
Imagine the best possible family life you could have in five years. Think about your actual
rela4ves, but also friends who are as close as family. Perhaps you live close to your parents.
Perhaps your children are grown and yet are s4ll close to you. Perhaps you spend a great deal of
4me with people you care about. Be realis4c, but imagine all the possible ways you could enjoy
your family and close friends.

Finding Awe
Awe is the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our understanding
of the world. Scien4sts tell us that awe, even more than other posi4ve emo4ons, increases our
sense of happiness and fulfillment by making us feel that we are connected to others around us.
Some research even suggests that a daily dose of awe will make us more resilient and boost our
immune system.
Use this worksheet to bring more awe into your life.

Name three things in nature that always bring you a sense of awe.

Crea4ng a Personal Mission Statement
If you want to live each day to the fullest, you will need to think about what you really want out
of your life and the principles and values that will guide your day-to-day decisions. This
worksheet is designed to help you create a personal mission statement (some4mes called a
“purpose statement”), which can be a simple road map to help you live a happy and fulfilling
life.
A personal mission statement provides clarity and gives you a sense of purpose. It defines who
you are and how you will live.
A personal mission statement is different from the goals you have for yourself. In fact, it is what
your goals are based on. A personal mission statement includes your values, beliefs, and
priori4es in just a sentence or two. A personal mission statement will not only show you the
path to make your decisions each day, it will also give you permission to say “no” to the things
in your life that are not really important to you.
It is important to note that a personal mission statement is not wriZen in stone, but rather it
will change over 4me as your life experiences change. Your personal mission statement should
be focused on self-discovery as well as purpose.
Here are some personal mission statements from some people you may know:
“To be a teacher. And to be known for inspiring my students to be more than they
thought they could be.”
– Oprah Winfrey
“To have fun in [my] journey through life and learn from [my] mistakes.”
– Sir Richard Branson
“My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some
passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.”
– Maya Angelou
You can use this worksheet to help you think about your personal mission statement. Think
about people you admire and the traits they have that you think are important.
Write down the names of three people you admire.

Iden4fying Your Signature Strengths
Research in the area of posi4ve psychology suggests that an important way to achieve
greater happiness is to understand and prac4ce your signature strengths (also called
“character strengths”). Review the list of strengths below and rate each strength on the

Things You Can Do To Li^ Your Spirits
Most people who are depressed cut back on their ac4vi4es, even the ones they used to enjoy.
Not surprisingly, when you stop doing things that give you pleasure, then your mood gets even
worse and life’s burdens take on more importance.
However, you can reverse this downward cycle when you commit to doing pleasurable ac4vi4es
each day. Make a list of five ac4vi4es you can do to li^ your spirits and have a more posi4ve
mood throughout the day. Try to do at least one of the ac4vi4es each day for a week, ra4ng
your mood from 1 to 10 immediately a^er each ac4vity, where 1 = sad or feeling empty and 10
= happy and energized. If you can commit to doing more pleasurable ac4vi4es each day, you will
likely make faster progress in overcoming your depression.

Crea4ng a Gra4tude Journal
Researchers who study why some people are happier than others consistently find that
adop4ng a daily “abtude of gra4tude” li^s our spirits and acts as a barrier to the small and
large things that would normally upset us. People who are consistently grateful have been
found to be happier, more energe4c, more hopeful, and report more frequent posi4ve
emo4ons.
Being grateful is more than just saying “thank you.” Robert Emmons, a prominent researcher on
how gra4tude affects our lives, describes gra4tude as “a felt sense of wonder, thankfulness, and
apprecia4on for life.”
Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a professor at the University of California and author of The How of
Happiness, notes that gra4tude has many benefits in our daily lives, focusing us on posi4ve
experiences, helping us be more connected to others, and increasing our sa4sfac4on with life.
Use the “Daily Gra4tude Calendar” to record something you are grateful for each day. Don’t
repeat yourself, but rather look for something new to be grateful for as soon as you wake up.
“Cul4vate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you, and to give thanks
con4nuously. And because all things have contributed to your advancement, you should include
all things in your gra4tude.”
– Ralph Waldo Emerson

Feeling BeZer Through Spiritual Awareness
Broadly speaking, spirituality is the meaning that people seek in their lives through connec4on
with a higher power. While formal religion can certainly provide a sense of spirituality, many
people seek to bring spirituality into their lives outside their religion.
Research tells us that becoming more spiritual may be par4cularly helpful for people with
emo4onal problems, helping them deal with a variety of life’s challenges. This makes sense
because spirituality emphasizes the importance of a posi4ve outlook, reflec4on on one’s goals
and purpose, and seeking inner strength and peace in the context of living a value-based life.
This worksheet is designed to help you iden4fy spiritual prac4ces to help you through difficult
4mes and also to enrich your day-to-day life. Although you may feel beZer from the very first
4me you try one of these prac4ces, it is worth no4ng that bringing spirituality into your life is a
long-term commitment and you will see the most important changes to your emo4onal wellbeing over 4me.
Look at the list of spiritual prac4ces below and check off the ones you think would be most
helpful. Then answer the ques4ons for each of the prac4ces you have checked to help you
commit to one or more of these prac4ces. Add other prac4ces you would like to try.
_____Spending 4me apprecia4ng nature (e.g., taking a walk in the woods or by the beach)
_____Medita4on
_____Prayer
_____Community service
_____Keeping a journal
_____Reading books about spirituality
_____Yoga

Finding Joy and Balance in Your Life
The G.L.A.D. technique was developed by Donald Altman as a par4cularly useful approach to
developing a posi4ve abtude toward life (see The Mindfulness Toolbox, New Harbinger
Publica4ons). It is designed to help people pay aZen4on to posi4ve things that are around them
all of the 4me but that frequently go unno4ced.
While some people may want to fill in the G.L.A.D. worksheet throughout the day, it is more
prac4cal to fill it out at the end of the day. Make copies of this worksheet so that you can
prac4ce the technique every day for at least three weeks. A^er three weeks, your “posi4ve
mindfulness” will become a habit. A^er three weeks, you might want to use the worksheet just
once a week, but you should s4ll do it on a regular schedule (for example every Sunday night).
Developing “posi4ve mindfulness” is par4cularly important for people who are stressed and
depressed, but it should also be considered a resiliency tool which can help you find daily
happiness in your life.
Keep your worksheets together and look at them from 4me to 4me. You may also want to share
the posi4ve experiences you write down on your worksheet with others. Sharing your posi4ve
thoughts and feelings makes them even more important.

Loving Kindness Medita4on
The “loving kindness medita4on” is a simple exercise in which you recite posi4ve thoughts
about yourself and others. Saying this medita4on aloud can immediately improve your mood
because it focuses you on the posi4ve things in your life and your sense of purpose. The effects
of this prac4ce can also be surprisingly long las4ng. Studies show that the regular prac4ce of
this medita4on can increase your resiliency and bring you a sense of fulfillment you may have
never thought possible.
This medita4on has five simple steps. It begins by invi4ng you to express posi4ve thoughts
about yourself, followed by posi4ve thoughts of someone you care about. Then it requires
something you may not have done before: you send out posi4ve thoughts toward someone you
feel neutral about, followed by posi4ve thoughts toward someone you dislike. Then you direct
your posi4ve thoughts out to the universe.
This medita4on takes just a few minutes, but it goes a long way to opening up your posi4ve
emo4ons and lebng go of your nega4ve judgments.
Here’s how to do it:
1. Sit comfortably with your eyes closed.
2. Imagine yourself in a place where you feel complete sa4sfac4on and have an allencompassing sense of well-being. Perhaps you are sibng on a beach at sunset with the
warm glow of the sun s4ll on your skin. Perhaps you are in your own living room,
surrounded by people who love you. Think of a place that makes you unspeakably happy.
3. Now say the following phrases out loud.
38
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
I wish for happiness, calm, and peace for myself.
Now visualize someone you care about and say:
I wish for happiness, calm, and peace for you.
Now visualize someone you feel neutral about—
someone you neither like nor dislike—and say:
I wish for happiness, calm, and peace for you.
Now think of someone you don’t like and say:
I wish you happiness, calm, and peace.
Finally, direct your loving kindness to the universe and say:
May all beings everywhere find happiness and peace.
NEW WAYS TO THINK
Using Coping Statements to Talk Back to Your Depression
Accep4ng your thoughts and feelings can help you move past your difficul4es. Taking a posi4ve
“solu4on-focused” view of your life can s4mulate a posi4ve and op4mis4c way of viewing your
life. Look at the statements below and put a check by the statements that ring true for you.
_____I can’t change what has already happened.
_____I’m not going to drive myself crazy with things I can’t change.
_____Dwelling on the past keeps me from apprecia4ng what is in the present.
_____I can accept things the way they are.
_____This feels bad, but it is a normal reac4on and will pass.
_____I have dealt with problems before and I can deal with this.
_____Thoughts are just happening in my brain; they are not THE TRUTH.
_____I can learn from the past to solve present and future problems.

Identifying Your Automatic and Irrational Thoughts
Psychologists believe that people who are depressed have certain kinds of automa4c and
irra4onal thoughts that distort their view of themselves and their world. These thoughts are
“irra4onal” because they are not based on any facts; however, depressed people s4ll act as if
they are true. Recognizing your automa4c thoughts and replacing them with ra4onal ones can
be an important part of overcoming your depression.
First, think about these different kinds of automa4c and irra4onal thoughts below and see if you
can give an example of when you have this type of irra4onal thought.
Discoun4ng
You insist that your accomplishments or posi4ve quali4es “don’t count.”
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Mind reading
You assume that people are reac4ng nega4vely to you, when there’s no real evidence for this.
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Fortune telling
You arbitrarily predict that things will turn out badly.
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
42
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
Magnifica4on/Minimiza4on
You blow nega4ve possibili4es way out of propor4on. You minimize the importance of posi4ve
interac4ons or events.
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Emo4onal reasoning
You reason from how you feel rather than from what logic would tell you. For example, you
might feel that someone is disappointed with you, even when there is no evidence this is true.
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
“Should” statements
You cri4cize yourself or other people with “shoulds” or “shouldn’ts,” “musts,” “oughts,” and
“have tos”
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Labeling
You iden4fy with your shortcomings. Instead of saying, “I made a mistake,” you tell yourself,
“I’m a jerk,” “a fool,” “a loser.”
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
43
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
Catastrophic thinking
You imagine that the worst possible thing could happen in a given situa4on, even though there
is no evidence that this might be so.
Example____________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Looking back at the types of automa4c/irra4onal thoughts, which ones do you think you are
most likely to have?

Talking Back to Your Automa4c and Irra4onal Thoughts
See if you can “catch” each 4me you have an automa4c/irra4onal thought. Write it down in the
first column. Then, write down how much you believe that this thought is true from 1 to 100
percent. In the third column, write down the type of automa4c thought this represents (refer to
the previous worksheet). Then, write a ra4onal response to this automa4c thought, based on
facts. Finally, write down how much you believe your ra4onal response is true, from 1 to 100
percent. Make copies of this worksheet and use it to evaluate your thoughts every 4me you are
feeling discouraged or down on yourself.

Giving Up Nega4ve Judgments About Others
Many people have a difficult 4me rela4ng to others without being highly judgmental. Some
people divide the world into “good” and “bad” with no room to see that the people around
them have many different quali4es. Other people are overly cri4cal. They focus most of their
energy on the things people do that they think are wrong, and so they are o^en angry, unhappy,
and lonely.
Examples of Nega4ve Judgments
Do any of these thoughts sound like ones you have? Fill in the blanks below.
• My _____________________ is so mean, I can’t stand to be with her.
• _____________________ is not a good friend, because I keep invi4ng her out but she never
invites me to go with her.
• _____________________ is incompetent and my work is miserable.
• My _____________________ thinks about everyone but me.
• My _____________________ is really a loser. No wonder he/she is having problems.
Write down three nega4ve judgments that you have had recently.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
If you are prone to nega4vely judging others, it is probably detrac4ng from your own happiness
and life sa4sfac4on. This worksheet can help. You don’t have to “change” the way you think or
feel, but rather just observe and acknowledge your nega4ve and cri4cal thoughts as if they were
clouds floa4ng by in the sky. In other words, don’t react to these thoughts with any par4cular
emo4on; just let them come and go.
Use the chart on the next page to keep track of all your nega4ve judgments about the people in
your life for three days.

Recording Your Nega4ve Judgments
 As soon as you write down each thought, take a deep breath and let the thought float away. Record
your nega4ve judgments for three consecu4ve days. Use addi4onal pages if you need them.

Solving Your Problems One Step at a Time
One of the most serious symptoms of depression is the belief that your problems are beyond
your control and will never get beZer. But most problems can be addressed by sebng a realis4c
goal and determining the steps necessary to achieve that goal.
For example, Diane was depressed because she felt overwhelmed by the stress in her life and
she had very few things that made her happy. Diane lived with her elderly mother, who had
several serious illnesses. Diane felt that she had no 4me for herself and no social life. Diane
didn’t like her job as a warehouse manager, but it paid well and she needed the money, and she
didn’t feel that she had the 4me or energy to find a more fulfilling job.
Diane began the process of improving her life by lis4ng her two main goals:
• To engage in more social ac4vi4es and meet new people
• To find a more interes4ng job that paid as least as much as her old job
Diane felt that the first goal was easier to achieve and would help her feel beZer about her life
more quickly.
She began by wri4ng a goal that was achievable and measurable. It is important to have a goal
that is measurable so you can know what to work toward and to be clear when your goal has
been accomplished. Diane’s goal was: “to go out and meet new people at least once a week.”
Diane broke her goal into small steps or sub-goals. They were:
1. To make a list of ac4vity groups in her area by doing research on the Internet
2. To decide on three ac4vity groups that she would enjoy
3. To find several people who would stay with her mother when she was out
4. To go out to an ac4vity once a week (even if she wasn’t in the mood)
Within a month, Diane had found a knibng group that met every Friday night at a local
Starbucks. Through the group, she made a few friends and began to feel less isolated in her life.
Of course, not every journey to solving a problem is so straighxorward. Some4mes you have to
change the steps you must take to achieve a goal. Some4mes there are unforeseen obstacles,
and many 4mes mo4va4on is a problem. Let’s face it, change is hard. But sebng a goal and
wri4ng down the steps to achieve your goal is an important part of the process of crea4ng a
happier and more fulfilling life.

Developing Your Nurturing Inner Voice
Many people have an internal voice that is constantly cri4cizing them and aZacking their selfworth. If this is true for you, this voice may have originated with a parent, a teacher, or another
overly cri4cal adult in your childhood. It may be a mixture of harsh comments you heard when
you were growing up. You may not even remember just where or when the cri4cizing voice in
your head appeared, but it is important to know that you don’t have to listen to it anymore.
Instead of listening to the cri4cal voices in your head, you can develop a nurturing inner voice
that you can listen to when you are feeling low and you are ques4oning your self-worth.
Begin by wri4ng down five nurturing statements that you want to hear. These are the kind of
statements that someone who cares deeply about you might say to you.
Some examples might be:
I’m really proud of what you have accomplished.
You always amaze me.
You should give yourself more credit for all that you do.
Now write in things you’d like to hear.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Now think of someone you consider to be very nurturing. It can be someone you know or it can
be someone you don’t know well at all but you think of as a nurturing person. It could even be
someone from fic4on or someone you made up in your mind.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
54
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
Now imagine that this person is saying any or all of the above statements to you. Describe the
situa4on (room, clothing, body posi4on) you are in.
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Think about this scene un4l it is very vivid in your mind. What else is this person saying to you
or doing that makes you feel cared for?
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
What are you saying back?
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________________________
Now change the channel to your cri4cal voice, just for a moment. Imagine that your cri4cal
voice is back talking to you in your head. What is it saying?

NEW WAYS TO THINK
Using a Contract to Commit to Change
Behavioral contracts are not just for kids. In fact, creating a behavioral contract and sharing it
with others is one of the most effective ways for adults to motivate themselves to make changes
in their lives. Use the contract below to commit yourself to changes that will help you overcome
your depression or any other problem that is holding you back in your life.
I, ________________________________________________(name), agree to
(specific behavior you want to change) ______________________________________.

Acts of Kindness Lead to Happiness
Researchers tell us that being kind will not just benefit people you help but can also make you
happy, too, and can li^ your mood on a permanent basis. According to research by Dr. Sonja
Lyubomirsky, author of The How of Happiness, kindness can start a chain of posi4ve social
consequences, bringing you closer to others and helping you appreciate the most posi4ve
aspects of human nature.
The Random Acts of Kindness movement advocates thoughxul and considerate acts as a way of
life, but research actually shows that the “happiness benefits” of acts of kindness are greatest
when you consciously decide to do a kind act just one day a week. On that day, you should seek
to do a significant act of kindness, for example, not just holding the door for someone but
perhaps taking the 4me to write a note of apprecia4on to someone important in your life.
Use this worksheet to plan and then record your weekly act of kindness.

Increasing Flow Experiences
In psychological terms, “flow” is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in a feeling
of energized focus while performing a challenging ac4vity. People more commonly call this
“being in the zone.” Many psychologists feel that when people have frequent experiences of
“flow,” preferably several 4mes a day, they experience more posi4ve emo4ons, as well as a
sense of well-being and purpose.
Flow is a feeling in which even difficult tasks become easy. You lose track of 4me because you
are so involved in the ac4vity. Runners o^en talk about a “runner’s high,” when running even
long distances becomes almost effortless. Some people experience flow while doing a hobby,
like gardening or restoring their car. Some people are lucky enough to experience flow doing
their work.
Sonja Lyubomirsky, in her book The How of Happiness, writes, “The experience of flow leads us
to be involved in life (rather than be alienated from it), to enjoy ac4vi4es (rather than to find
them dreary), to have a sense of control (rather than helplessness), and to feel a strong sense of
self (rather than unworthiness). All these factors imbue life with meaning and lend it a richness
and intensity. And happiness.”
You will know you are experiencing a flow ac4vity when:
1. You’re completely involved in what you’re doing; you’re completely focused on what
you’re doing.
2. There’s a sense of great pleasure as you perform a flow task; you feel outside of
everyday reality.
3. There’s a sense of inner clarity; you know what needs to be done and you get immediate
feedback on how well you’re doing.
4. You know that the ac4vity is doable, even though it may be difficult; you’re confident
that you have the necessary skills to complete the task successfully.
5. You lose your sense of self, and your worries and concerns dri^ away.
6. You lose track of 4me, and you’re completely focused on the present moment.
7. There’s an intrinsic mo4va4on; whatever you’re doing to produce flow becomes its own
reward.
59
Copyright 2017 Between Sessions Resources
The feelings of flow are a “natural high” and, in fact, your brain does produce chemicals that
make you feel “high,” including endorphins and endocannabinoids, which are a naturally
synthesized version of THC. This is the chemical responsible for the buzz that marijuana
produces.
This worksheet will examine how you can have more periods of flow in your life.
Use this sheet to think about the ac4vi4es that create flow. Then, use the chart on the next
page to record your success at crea4ng flow ac4vi4es each day.

Prac4cing Compassionate Self-Care
People who are depressed are typically very hard on themselves. They may feel and act like
their depression is their fault or that they are somehow “flawed.” Many people suffering from
depression feel that their past ac4ons and choices are the reasons for their depression and they
have an internal dialogue that keeps them feeling low.
If this sounds like you, then you know that this type of abtude and behavior is no help at all.
Rather than being hard on yourself, you can prac4ce compassionate self-care. You can treat
yourself with understanding and kindness, just the way you would treat a friend in need.
Prac4cing compassionate self-care is not being self-indulgent. Self-indulgence is when you give
yourself more than you need, like ea4ng two desserts or buying clothes when your closets are
already burs4ng. Compassionate self-care is also not self-pity. Self-pity is when you feel that
your problems are worse than the problems of everyone else. Compassionate self-care
recognizes the fact that all humans have problems and all humans make mistakes. And that
includes you!
In this worksheet, you should list all the ways you would treat a friend in need. Think of
someone you care about very much and imagine that he or she is having a very difficult 4me.

Crea4ng a BeZer Day
When you are feeling depressed, you may not feel like doing anything at all. People who are
severely depressed some4mes say that they don’t even feel like gebng out of bed in the
morning.
Planning your day so that it includes meaningful ac4vi4es can help mo4vate you to spend more
4me doing things that will li^ your mood and bring purpose to your life.
Begin by wri4ng down ac4vi4es that will make any day more meaningful.
An ac4vity that expresses my values:

Overcoming Depression with the Help of Exercise
Regular exercise can help you overcome your anxiety in a number of ways. During exercise, your
brain increases the produc4on of chemicals that can li^ your mood and regulate your emo4ons.
With regular exercise, you will feel stronger and more confident and be more likely to feel that
you can make posi4ve changes in your life. Exercise will also increase the oxygen flow to your
brain, which may help you think more clearly, more ra4onally, and more posi4vely.

Do you have a hard 4me falling asleep or staying asleep? A lack of sleep will reduce the
serotonin levels in your brain, which may make it harder to control your moods during the day.
There are a variety of techniques that can help you get the sleep you need, but, of course, they
only work if you are diligent at trying them and then using the ones that work best. Gebng
enough sleep is an important part of your overall plan to overcome your depression and is also
important for your general health.
There are a variety of medica4ons available to help you sleep, including prescrip4on
medica4on, herbs, and supplements, but always consult a physician before taking any kind of
sleep aid.
Here are some other things you can try. On the chart on the next page, keep track of your sleep
and the methods you use to sleep beZer. Track your progress for at least two weeks.
Techniques to Help You Get More Sleep
• Listen to so^ music, read, take a warm shower, or meditate before going to bed.
• Exercise for at least a half-hour each day, but not before you go to bed.
• Write a to-do list for the following day and then clear your head of those concerns.
• Prac4ce deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxa4on before bed4me.
• Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nico4ne, either en4rely or at least in the evenings.
• Keep your bedroom at a cool temperature (65–68 degrees).
• If you are sensi4ve to light and sound, wear earplugs and a sleep mask or try a white-noise
machine to mask the sound. There are various white-noise apps available if you have a
smartphone.
• If you are having trouble falling asleep, get out of bed and do some light ac4vity (like reading) in
another room. Go back to bed when you feel drowsy.
• Go to bed and get up at the same 4me every day.
• Avoid ea4ng heavy meals for at least two to three hours before bed.
• Make sure your maZress and pillows are comfortable.
• Write down other ideas to help you get more sleep.

How Diet Affects Your Mood
Diet, stress, and mood are all intertwined, so it’s important to consider what you’re pubng in
your body, not only for your physical health but also for your emo4onal well-being.
It is not necessary to go to extremes in changing your diet. By simply being more mindful of
what you’re pubng in your body, you can find small ways to improve, and that can add up to big
changes.
The following are some of the substances that can affect your depression:
• Caffeine: You’ll find this s4mulant in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, energy drinks, and some
over-the-counter medica4ons. The temporary boost it provides can end in fa4gue,
headache, and tension. Caffeine has also been iden4fied as a poten4al trigger for anxiety
aZacks and a contributor to other health issues such as insomnia, heartburn, aggression,
irritability, heart palpita4ons, and high blood pressure.
• Salt: Sodium is present in many processed foods, so check labels and look for low-sodium
or salt-free alterna4ves. Also, be aware of how much salt you use while cooking. Sodium
consump4on affects fluid reten4on, weight, and blood pressure, all of which, in turn, can
affect your mood.
• Sugar: Excessive intake of simple sugars (such as white or brown sugar and honey) can
cause health problems such as diabetes and hypoglycemia. Also, the temporary upli^ing
effects come with some other serious downsides, including an increased risk of depression
in those who have a sugar-heavy diet.
• Preserva4ves and hormones: These substances are present in processed foods and many
types of meats. Our bodies were not built to handle these addi4ves, and their possible
side effects have been heavily debated. Swapping in some whole, unprocessed, organic
foods can help reduce consump4on of these poten4ally harmful substances.
• Nico4ne and alcohol: Introducing these substances into your system can cause a range of
problems, not the least of which is aggrava4ng anxiety. Nico4ne is a s4mulant, like
caffeine, and alcohol a depressant. The addic4ve proper4es of both nico4ne and alcohol
have also been well documented.
It should also be men4oned that what you don’t put in your body can also be problema4c.
Nutrient deficiencies and dehydra4on can cause irritability, anxiety, and fa4gue. So stop
skipping meals and make sure you are drinking enough water.

COPING WITH STRESS AND DIFFICULT FEELINGS
Breaking the Cycle of Stress and Depression
Dealing with your stress in a construc4ve way can be an important part of overcoming your
depression. Of course, not all stress is bad. A small amount of stress is actually good for you,
keeping you alert and mo4vated. But sustained stress will elevate stress biochemicals such as
cor4sol, which can take a toll on your mood and your body. Over 4me, cor4sol can also weaken
your immune system and even affect your memory.
Sustained stress also interferes with “happiness biochemicals” such as serotonin and dopamine.
These are biochemicals produced in the brain and body that translate into feelings of calm,
happiness, and well-being. They are the same biochemicals that are affected when you take
an4-depressant medica4on.
The connec4on between stress and depression is complex and circular. Besides the direct
impact on your body and mood, excess stress can lead to poor habits like drinking and
overea4ng, which will then exacerbate your feelings of depression.
Fortunately, you have it in your power to break the cycle of stress and depression. Researchers
tell us that specific ac4vi4es can reduce the harmful biochemicals associated with prolonged
stress and elevate the biochemicals associated with feelings of sa4sfac4on and well-being.
This worksheet shows you things you can do every day to fight the nega4ve impact of stress on
your depression. When you make these ac4vi4es daily habits, they will not only help you
overcome your depression but will also help prevent physical problems.
Put a check mark by the ac4vi4es you are most likely to do. See if you can find one ac4vity to do
in each category. Then es4mate the 4me you will do the ac4vi4es each day. Finally, put a check
mark when you have accomplished this ac4vity each day in a week. Keep this chart for three
weeks.

Dealing with Shame and Guilt
Some4mes people become fixated on blaming themselves for certain situa4ons or events. They
blame themselves for something terrible that has happened as if they were the sole cause of a
par4cular misfortune. Yet it is very rare that a single person causes a complex event. People
who have suffered a trauma o^en feel shame and guilt, even when they had no part in causing
the trauma and may have even been a vic4m.
This worksheet is designed to help you reduce your shame and guilt by thinking about the many
factors that might have caused a par4cular event.
Describe a situa4on where you blamed yourself.

Gebng Through Difficult Times with Mindfulness
As you may know, mindfulness is a technique that Western psychology has borrowed from the
Buddhist tradi4on of Mindful Medita4on. Mindfulness involves bringing your aZen4on to what
is happening in the present moment. When you are “mindful,” you are aware of both your
internal experiences as well as what you experience in the world around you. As you observe
your internal and external experiences, you try not to judge them as good or bad, or even react
to them at all. When you are mindful, you are aware and present in the moment.
Does this sound simple? It might be a liZle harder than you think. But prac4cing mindfulness is
well worth the effort as it has proven to be very helpful in overcoming depression. Mindfulness
helps you be aware of your nega4ve thoughts and feelings, without judging them. As you
prac4ce mindfulness, your nega4ve thoughts and feelings eventually make them less powerful.
Many studies have also shown that there are measurable health benefits when you prac4ce
mindfulness on a regular basis. These include boos4ng the immune system, improving memory,
and increasing your ability to focus.
There are two main types of mindfulness. The first is called Mindful Medita4on and refers to
sebng aside some 4me each day to prac4ce mindfulness. There are many books and audio
resources to help you learn Mindful Medita4on. Here is an example of Mindful Medita4on from
Dartmouth College Health Center. hZps://www.betweensessions.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/
Mindful-Medita4on.mp3.
The second type of mindfulness occurs in everyday life and involves prac4cing mindful
awareness in everyday ac4vi4es. You prac4ce mindfulness while you are walking, while you are
ea4ng, even while you are doing a chore like sweeping the floor. All you have to do is be aware
of your inner and outer experiences without trying to judge them or change them. You can use
the worksheet on the next page to record prac4cing mindfulness at least once a day.

Accepting Unpleasant Experiences, Thoughts, and Feelings
We use language to define our experiences, including those that have caused unpleasant
feelings. By labeling experiences nega4vely, we create the tendency to limit, avoid, or control
situa4ons so that the discomfort associated with them will not be repeated. When you are
depressed, you may be avoiding experiences just because they have a nega4ve associa4on, but
avoiding these situa4ons may be restric4ng your life and keeping you more depressed.
This worksheet will act as a guide to help you understand that your experience of the present
moment does not have to be determined by the past. Accep4ng unpleasant internal
experiences, rather than ac4vely avoiding them, creates opportuni4es for posi4ve and
rewarding experiences that you might otherwise have missed.
Iden4fy five nega4ve internal experiences that cause you to severely limit, avoid, or control
certain ac4vi4es (for example, anxiety, worry, sadness, jealousy, fear, insecurity, etc.):

CONNECTING TO OTHERS
Communica4ng Your Needs and Feelings with “I”
Statements
Some4mes people don’t tell others how they feel, which can lead to a variety of frustra4ng
problems. It helps when you prac4ce using “I” statements, like the ones on this worksheet.
“I” statements are a method of saying precisely how you feel and what you want others to
understand. Using “I” statements doesn’t mean that you’ll get everything you want, but at
least people will understand what is important to you. This worksheet will help you think
about making your feelings clearer to specific people. Fill it in with different people in mind,
and then prac4ce using similar statements in real-life situa4ons.
Perhaps someone in your life could also benefit from making clear “I” statements? You
should also consider giving this worksheet to people who might benefit from communica4ng
their needs more effec4vely.
Fill in these “I” statements with a par4cular person in mind:
Name of person:__________________________________________________________
I feel because______________________________________________.
I would like it if you would__________________________________________________.
I really want_____________________________________________________________.
I hope you understand that_________________________________________________.

Don’t Be Alone
Humans are social animals, and our gene4c makeup predisposes us to want to seek the
company of others. But, like most gene4c character traits, there appears to be a significant
varia4on in how much individuals desire to be social. Some people say they can’t stand to be
alone for even a few hours. Others say they prefer to be alone much of the 4me. But, despite
the varia4on in the desire for social contact, from a psychological perspec4ve, social isola4on
can be a big problem, par4cularly during 4mes of emo4onal stress. Ideally, people should have
at least several close friends, as well as a group of people who make them feel they are
connected to a community. A close-knit family, of course, is also important.
If you find yourself being alone much of the 4me—even if it “feels” okay to you—you should
consider increasing your social contact. Take a look at the social ac4vi4es listed below. When
you get up each morning, think about at least one social ac4vity you can do each day.
Note: Internet-based social ac4vi4es like social media and email are helpful but they do not
replace real-life contact with people.
Social Ac9vi9es Checklist
(Choose at least one to do each day)
_____Have dinner with a friend.
_____AZend a Meetup (go to Meetup.com for groups in your area).
_____Take a walk with a friend.
_____AZend a community service group (Rotary Club, Kiwanis, and so on).
_____Reconnect with friends and family. List two or three people who come to mind:
 _____________________ _____________________ _____________________
_____AZend a spiritual or religious group.
_____Go on a nature-related ac4vity (e.g., hiking, bird watching, travel).
_____AZend a hobby- or cra^-related group (e.g., knibng, photography, etc.).
_____AZend a course.
_____AZend a community or poli4cal mee4ng.
_____AZend a support group.
_____Volunteer to help others.
_____AZend local lectures at the library.
83

Building Your Support System
It will be much easier to overcome your problems with the support of others. Some people feel
that one person, like a spouse or significant other, should provide all the support they need, but
developing a support network is preferred.
This worksheet can help you think about people who can support you in various areas of your
life. If you have difficulty thinking of people, think of people who could possibly fill this role, and
then work toward making this happen. O^en, you’ll find you can get the support you need by
just asking for it.
Write down at least one person you know who fits into each category.
Someone I can discuss a personal problem with:

CREATING A PERMANENT CHANGE
What Has Helped You?
Personal change can be a long and some4mes unexpected process. You can find solu4ons to
your problems and conflicts from sudden insight or by following a carefully cra^ed plan. You can
find help from working with your therapist and also from books, friends, and things you see on
the Internet and social media, and much more.
Whatever your process of discovering solu4ons to your problems and conflicts, wri4ng down
what you have learned will be an important part of making las4ng changes.
This worksheet is designed to help you think about what has helped you along your journey to
overcome your problems. Take some 4me, at least once a month, to fill in the worksheet. You
will likely find added benefit from sharing it with your therapist or a close friend. Of course, you
can also use this worksheet more frequently. Using it more frequently may be helpful in 4mes of
stress and during difficult life transi4ons.

Overcoming Setbacks
Overcoming depression takes a lot of work, and you may experience setbacks for a variety of
reasons. Don’t be upset if you have a setback in dealing with your depression. Setbacks are
common because stress and change in your life are constant. And don’t let setbacks give you
the feeling that you are back to where you started. Setbacks are temporary, just a sign that you
need to pay aZen4on to the kind of life you want to live every day.
The easiest way to avoid setbacks is to prepare for them. Filling out this worksheet will help you
think about the kinds of things that can cause a setback and recognize the early signs that your
depression may be recurring. Answer these ques4ons thoroughly and honestly.
Write down the most likely situa4ons that could cause a setback.

Keeping Track of How Medica4on Affects Your Depression
Many people decide to take medica4on to help with their depression, but they are o^en under
the misconcep4on that this will provide quick relief. In fact, while there have been many
advances in psychopharmacology, finding the right medica4on to help you with your depression
will almost always take some 4me.
There are different types of medica4ons that help with depression and the anxiety that
frequently accompanies it. O^en, medica4ons are used in combina4on, and it takes 4me and
pa4ence to figure exactly which combina4on of medica4ons will work best for you.
Unfortunately, there is no simple formula that will guide a physician to give you the exact
medica4on that will help you with your depression.
Keeping track of how you feel and func4on is really the only way for your prescribing physician
to know which medica4ons will help your depression. Use this worksheet to keep track of your
prescrip4on and non-prescrip4on medica4on, and bring it with you whenever you consult a
medical doctor.
It is important to remember that depression can also be a side effect of medica4ons that you
take for other purposes. Oral contracep4ves, drugs that treat high blood pressure, drugs that
treat high cholesterol, and even certain medica4ons that treat acne can trigger a depressed
mood. Always consult with your physician and pharmacist about the side effects of your
prescrip4on and non-prescrip4on medica4on and ask how they can possibly affect your mood.
Keeping Track of Your Medica4on
Use this sheet to keep track of how your medica4on affects you, and share it with your
prescribing physician.

Preface & Acknowledgements
In communities where little or no mental health care exists, people
with mental conditions are at risk for increased illness, stigma, and
abuse. Their fundamental right to mental health & happiness can be
compromised. Providing mental health care training to health care
workers and raising awareness among individuals within resourcelimited communities serves as a significant means not only to improving access to care to individuals but also to preserving human rights.
This field guide aims to be a contribution to the broader effort to improve the health, dignity, and quality of life for individuals in resource
-limited settings worldwide with mental conditions.

Introduction
PURPOSE OF THE GUIDE
The guidebook is intended to be a tool for community or hospitalbased healthcare providers working in settings where access to
mental health resources has been limited or non-existent (e.g. in
remotely located, economically impoverished, or nature/humanrelated disaster-affected communities in developed or developing
countries). It is a condensed, easy-reference handbook providing
an outline of core concepts and basic interventions in mental health
care. The guide is not a substitute for comprehensive psychiatric,
psycho-social, or other related mental health texts or training and it
is imperative that practitioners or health care workers are responsible in the interpretation and application of information. In addition, differences in cultural beliefs and practices will influence the
manner and extent to which the guide is used by individuals in
varied regions.
Presented in this guidebook is an allopathic (western) approach to
identifying and managing various mental health conditions. The
allopathic medical system represents only one method for dealing
with mental health issues and other systems of care may have a
different relevance or applicability in varied parts of the world.
Introduction
USING THE GUIDE
How Healthcare Providers Of Varied Disciplines Can Use Different Aspects Of The Guide
Health providers of varied disciplines will find information in the
field guide relevant to their practice. In addition, educators can
use different aspects of the manual as a source of material for different types and levels of training activity.
All chapters will provide readers with a basic understanding of key
topics in the field of mental health. Descriptions of conditions and
important issues within the mental health field are written using
terminology that can be appreciated by both the professional and
the lay person.
The “Medication Guide” section may be especially useful to allopathic physicians and other clinicians such as physician assistants,
nurse practitioners, and medical officers (who have the authority to
prescribe medication under the supervision of a physician in some
countries). In areas using allopathic methods, where nurses, midwives, and social workers are called upon to provide support for
people with psychological distress, the counseling interventions,
contained in chapters discussing specific mental health conditions,
may be particularly useful.
The mental health information contained in this guide useful to
varied health care providers (including laypeople, families, and
individuals with psychological conditions) is outlined on the following page.

MENTAL HEALTH INFORMATION FOUND IN THE GUIDE THAT MAY BE
USEFUL TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OF VARIED DISCIPLINES
I: Mental Health Worldwide
11
PART I: MENTAL HEALTH WORLDWIDE
The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined mental health
as a “state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or
her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can
work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution
to her or his community.”
Global mental health refers to the international perspective on
varied aspects of mental health and has been defined as “the area of
study, research and practice that places a priority on improving
mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people
worldwide” (Koplan et al, 2009). Neuropsychiatric disorders contribute to approximately 13% of the global burden of disease and
create (to varying degrees among countries) burden in every country in the world.
Assessments of mental health resources worldwide are done with
the aim of shedding light on the most recent global view of resources available to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders, provide
intervention, and protect human rights. WHO reports of mental
health worldwide have examined resources with regard to geographic region and economic status. Categorizing countries into
regions is one way to organize the huge volume of information
about mental health structures and services throughout the world.
In addition, looking at regions may be useful from an economic
perspective. It has been established that many nations have no or
very limited mental health programming and need to utilize the
support of other countries to develop a system of care. Being in a
region where a high percentage of neighboring countries have resources can be useful for a country in the same area that has limitations. In addition, using the resources of a nation nearby may be
less expensive and a faster process than relying on resources from a
far distance.
I: Mental Health Worldwide
12
An examination from the economic perspective allows the identification of specific types of mental health issues prevalent in
countries with different income levels. This information can potentially guide the planning of mental health policies, legislation,
programs and services. The information may also be useful to
funding agencies providing financial support to countries that
want to develop resources.
Limitations of Global Studies & Reports
Trying to understand the status of mental health care in countries
throughout the world has been a challenging process. Existing
reports and studies have taken the best measures possible to be
scientific and accurate in collecting, analyzing, and placing in
perspective results of data. Nevertheless, these studies are not
without their limitations.
 With regard to a discussion of mental health care by global region, data may be limited by the way regions have been categorized. In a report on global mental health (WHO, 2005)
“regions” are not necessarily divided precisely or purely by
global or physical location (i.e. a “region” may include countries
that are not physically located on the same continent). In some
cases, the “regional” similarity appears to be related to historical,
cultural, or economic factors that may link and make a group of
countries comparable for analysis.
Other limitations include an inability to obtain information from
all countries on all variables, variations in how different countries
define mental health concepts, and variations from country to
country in sources of information.
I: Mental Health Worldwide
13
Information presented in this section comes from reports and
studies that have inherent limitations, therefore specific conclusions and summary statements will have limitations as well. Data
from the WHO is particularly highlighted. One reviewing this
information should continue to follow subsequent studies, reports, and related literature from varied sources to gain a full and
accurate perspective of global mental health care.
Recent Data
Results of a recent assessment of 184 of 196 World Health Organization (WHO) member states (representing 95% of WHO
member states and 98% of the world’s population) have indicated
that there is a growing burden of neuropsychiatric disease and
that mental health resources remain insufficient (WHO 2011).
The burden of disease is much greater in low income countries
compared to high income countries. However, the number of
beds in mental hospitals is reduced in the majority of countries
which may be an indication of a shift from institutional care to
community-based care.
In the WHO 2011 report, geographic regions were classified as
Africa (AFR), the Americas (AMR), Eastern Mediterranean
(EMR), Europe (EUR), South/South-East Asia (SEAR), and the
Western Pacific (WPR) and income levels were described in
terms of high (gross national per capita income of US$ 12, 276 or
more), upper-middle (US$ 12,275 – $3,976), lower-middle (US$
3975 - $1006), and low (US$ 1005 or less). A summary of key
findings is provided in the next section.

Indicators of Global Mental Health (WHO, 2011)
1) Governance
2) Financing
3) Mental health care delivery of services
4) Human resources
5) Medicines for mental & behavioral disorders
6) Information systems.
1) Governance
Mental Health Policy
Data indicates that in about 60% of countries, a dedicated or officially approved mental health policy exists, covering approximately 72% of the world’s population. Dedicated mental health
policies are more present in EMR, EUR, and SEAR compared to
AFR, AMR, and WPR. Data from the World Bank income group
also indicates that mental health policies tend to exist in high income countries (77.1%) compared to low income countries
(48.7%). Regions with the highest percentage of countries that
have recently adopted or updated mental health policies include
WPR (87%), EMR (85%), and EUR (84%) while regions with the
lowest percentage of countries adopting or revising policies are
AFR (56%) and SEAR (57%). The AMR tallied 67% of its countries adopting or updating policies.
I: Mental Health Worldwide
15
Mental Health Plan
 In 72% of the WHO member countries providing data (accounting
for 95% of the world’s population), a mental health plan (or scheme
realizing the objectives of mental health policy) has been outlined.
Regions with the greatest percentage of countries with plans include
EMR (74%), SEAR (80%) and EUR (81%). Fewer plans were in
place in WPR (62%), AMR (66%), and AFR (67%). Regarding
income group, wealthier countries had a tendency to have plans
compared to countries with low income.
Mental Health Legislation
Worldwide, 59% of people live in a country where dedicated or
officially approved mental health legislation exists with legislation
present least in AFR (44.4%) and SEAR (40%) and most in AMR
(56.3%), EMR (57.9%), EUR (80.8%), and WPR (53.8%). Higher
(i.e. high and upper-middle) income countries tended to have legislation present compared to lower (i.e. lower-middle and low) income countries.
I: Mental Health Worldwide
16
2) Financing
The global median mental health expenditures per capita are $1.63
USD. There is a significant difference in median mental health
expenditures per capita among income groups, ranging from $0.20
USD in low income countries to $44.84 USD in high income
countries. The median percentage of health budget allocated to
mental health is highest in the EUR (5.0%), 3.75% in EMR, 1.95%
in WPR, 1.53% in AMR, 0.62% in AFR, and 0.44% in SEAR.
Regarding income group, the median percentage of health budget
allocated to mental health is highest for high income countries
(5.1%), 2.38% for upper-middle income countries, 1.90% for
lower-middle countries, and lowest or 0.53% for low income
countries. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of financial resources worldwide are directed toward mental hospitals /institutions as opposed
to community-based facilities (note: only 74 of 184 countries provided responses/data).
3) Mental Care Delivery of Services
The delivery of mental health services has been assessed with regard to a) services provided by primary health care (PHC) clinicians; b) mental health facilities (outpatient, day treatment, general
hospital psychiatric ward, community residential, and mental hospital facilities); and c) Aspects of service (length of mental hospital stay, follow up care, psychosocial interventions, and distribution of beds across facilities).
I: Mental Health Worldwide
17
a) PHC mental health care delivery
A majority of countries allow PHC physicians to prescribe (or
continue prescribing) medicines for mental and behavioral disorders either without restrictions (56%) or with some legal restrictions (40%). Restrictions include allowing prescriptions only in
emergency settings or in certain categories of medicines. The percentage of respondent countries not allowing any form of prescription by PHC physicians is 3%. Regarding nurses, 71% of countries
do not allow them to prescribe (or continue to prescribe), 26% of
countries allow prescribing with restrictions, and 3% allow prescribing without restrictions.
b) Mental health facilities
Regarding the number of facilities worldwide, outpatient facilities out number day treatment facilities, mental hospitals, community residential facilities, and psychiatric beds in general hospitals. Outpatient facilities are defined as facilities that focus on the
management of mental disorders and related clinical problems on
an outpatient basis. A day treatment facility refers to a facility
providing care to individuals during the day. A mental hospital is
defined as a specialized hospital-based facility that provides inpatient care and long-stay residential services for people with severe
mental disorders. A community residential facility is a nonhospital, community-based mental health facility that provides
overnight residence for people with mental disorders. The global
median number of outpatient facilities is 0.61 (per 100,000 population), 0.05 day treatment facilities, 0.04 mental hospitals, and 0.01
community residential facilities. The global median number of
psychiatric beds in general hospitals is 1.4 per 100,000 population.
c) Aspects of mental health service
High income countries tend to have more facilities and higher admission & utilization rates. A majority of people admitted to mental hospitals stay less than one year, however 23 % of those admitted still remain longer than a year.
I: Mental Health Worldwide
18
Regarding follow-up care (i.e. home visits to check medications,
to monitor signs of relapse, and to assist with rehabilitation), only
32% of countries have a majority of facilities that provide followup. Regarding income level 45% of high income countries provide follow-up care at a majority of facilities while 39% of uppermiddle income, 29% of lower-middle income, and 7% of low
income countries provide follow-up at a majority of facilities.
Regarding psychosocial interventions, only 44% of countries have
a majority of countries providing these services. Upper-middle
income and high income countries provide more psychosocial care
at a majority of facilities(61% and 59% respectively) compared to
lower-middle (34%) and low income countries (14%).
The global median rate for all beds in community residential facilities, mental hospitals, and psychiatric wards within general
hospitals is 3.2 beds per 100,000 population. Across WHO regions, there is great disparity. That is, the rates in the AFR (0.60),
EMR (0.62) and SEAR (0.23) are significantly lower than the
global mean, while the rate in EUR countries (7.09) is more than
double the world median.
4) Human resources
Worldwide, nurses represent the most common health professional
graduate working in the mental health sector (5.15 per 100,000
population). Globally, the next most common health professional
graduate working in the mental health sector is the medical doctor
(3.38 per 100,000 population). Regarding psychiatrists, the median rate ranges from 0.05 per 100,000 population in AFR to 8.59
per 100,000 population in EUR. Regarding other health personnel
working in the mental health sector, the median rate of other medical doctors ranges from 0.06 (AFR) to 1.14 (EUR) per 100,000
and for nurses ranges from 0.61 (AFR) to 21.93 (EUR) per
100,000. The median rate of psychologists ranges from 0 (WPR)
to 2.58 (EUR) per 100,000; social workers from 0 (WPR) to 1.12
(EUR) per 100,000; occupational therapists from 0 (SEAR and
WPR) to 0.57 (EUR) per 100,000; and other health workers from
I: Mental Health Worldwide
19
0.04 (SEAR) to 17.21 (EUR) per 100,000.
With regard to income group, there is significant disparity in the
number of doctors, nurses, and psychologists working in the mental health sector. For psychologists, the median rate of these clinicians working in the mental health sector is over 180 times greater
in high income compared to low income countries. In high income
countries, the median rate of psychiatrists is 8.59 compared to 0.05
in low income countries.
Worldwide, 2.8% of training for doctors is focused on psychiatry
and mental health related topics. Variability across regions exists
ranging from 2.2% in AMR to 4.0% in SEAR. For nurses, 3.3% of
training is focused on psychiatry and mental health-related topics
with moderate variability among regions ranging from 2.0% in
SEAR and 4.0% in AFR
5) Medicines for mental & behavioral disorders
Worldwide, the median expenditure per person per year on medicines for mental and behavioral disorders has been estimated to be
about $7 ($6.81) USD. However, the actual expenditure is likely
to be lower, as fewer than 30% of countries involved in the recent
WHO survey reported data, with those responding being disproportionately from high income countries.
6) Information systems
According to the WHO 2011 report, mental health data is collected
for individuals receiving treatment from mental hospitals, general
medical hospitals, day treatment and outpatient facilities. Less
data tends to be collected from primary care and community residential facilities.

PART II. MENTAL HEALTH CAPACITY BUILDING:
Increasing Access to Care Through Integration
& Collaboration

INTEGRATING MENTAL HEALTH CARE INTO EXISTING
HEALTH FACILITIES
Integrating mental health care into existing community facilities
can be an effective and efficient way to deliver mental health services to a large number of people living in areas with limited resources.
The integration process involves training existing primary healthcare practitioners based in the community and has been utilized in
western (allopathic) health systems. General practitioners and
healthcare workers are trained to make basic mental health assessments, to provide basic therapeutic interventions, and to refer to
more specialized interventions (if available) individuals who have
more serious psychiatric symptoms.
The integration process may also involve working with government agencies and other institutions to develop mental health policies, to promote deinstitutionalization and provision of community
-based acute and continuing care (for those with the most serious
and disabling conditions), and to incorporate mental health training
programs into medical, nursing, and graduate schools.
II. Mental Health Capacity Building
22
Telepsychiatry
Telepsychiatry refers to the use of communications and information technologies for training and, in some cases, directly delivering mental health care. It has been especially beneficial for populations living in isolated communities and remote regions.
Through video-conferencing ( one form of technology) general
practitioners in areas with limited or no access to mental health
services can gain access to a mental health specialist located in a
different region for ongoing consultations and supervision. In addition, mental health training programs that utilize telepsychiatry
have the potential to reduce costs while maintaining an efficient
and effective means for providing technical advice and information.

GUIDELINES FOR TEACHING PRIMARY HEALTHCARE
STAFF TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE
One approach to training primary healthcare staff to provide mental health care involves a) establishing learning goals and objectives that are relevant and applicable to the existing practices of the
primary care staff; b) developing theoretical mental health presentations and practical on-the-job supervision sessions that are effective and convenient; and c) utilizing comprehensive evaluations to
monitor and further enhance learning. It is important that those
teaching have the appropriate level of education or experience in
their areas of instruction and that trainees have a basic level of
understanding that will allow them to comprehend the instruction.
A) Establishing Learning Goals & Objectives – What is the information trainees are expected to learn?
Objectives may be defined as the learning needed to reach a particular goal. Trainers must decide on the desired goal of their training sessions and then develop clear objectives that will lead to the
goal.
Goals and objectives need to be relevant or directly applicable to
the real situations staff face in their primary care settings.
Example: A goal of a mental health training course for a group of
primary care doctors may be that they learn to provide an effective
treatment for an individual with a particular mental health condition. Objectives toward this goal may include their a) learning to
take a psychiatric history; b) learning the varied signs and symptoms of varied mental health conditions; and c) learning the varied
types of therapies to manage conditions. A number of objectives
may be involved in achieving an overall goal.

II. Mental Health Capacity Building
28
B) Theoretical Presentations & On-the Job Supervision
Lecture presentations
Theoretical information may be presented in many forms. A lecture format that is interactive (i.e. involves audience participation)
and offers a clear outline can be effective. However, lengthy or
numerous lectures should be minimized for primary care staff who
may be overwhelmed already with several tasks and responsibilities. Staff participating in training sessions will absorb more information if it is presented in a manner that is concise and relates directly to their existing work activities.
It can be helpful to consider the Who, What/Why, Where, and
How when outlining a lecture:
1) Who are you presenting to?
a) Understand who your audience is; know their level of education,
experience or understanding in general;
b) Always treat the audience respectfully and allow questions; provide clear explanations;
c) Take time to put an audience and yourself at ease by having
some informal interaction before getting into the core presentation
(e.g. use opening joke, story or “ice-breaker” activity).
II. Mental Health Capacity Building
29
2) What information or skills do you need them to understand and
Why is this information important for them to know?
a) Start with a welcome and introduction (and informal interaction);
b) Reiterate why it is important that they have attended;
c) Provide an outline of the session that states topics to be discussed and a general time frame for the discussion;
d) Make clear what they can expect from the session (desired outcome and objectives) and why it is important for them to attain this
information;
e) Start with a broad outline of the information and then get more
specific;
f) Conclude with a summary of the key points of the discussion.
 3) Where will you be presenting the information?
a)Take time to prepare your space so that it is conducive to effective learning (Is there enough space for all participants to see and
hear you? Are there electrical outlets in the room? Is there an
adequate setting for breaks?; Are toilets nearby? etc…).
II. Mental Health Capacity Building
30
4) Specifically How will I present the information (what types of
materials or aids will be useful in presenting the information)?
a) What aids are available and feasible to use (chalkboard or whiteboard? projectors?; flip charts?; microphones? Is there electricity
or a generator to power electronic aides? Etc…);
b) Are take-home materials used (books, handouts, brochures,
etc…).
On-the-job supervision
Theoretical information must be practically applied to real situations faced by the primary care staff. Having a knowledgeable
supervisor teach and monitor as a trainee works directly with patients will reinforce that trainee’s learning and understanding of the
theoretical concepts. Clients should be made aware of the role of
the supervisor prior to sessions and should be reassured that information will not be used inappropriately.
C) Evaluation Of Teaching
Evaluations of the trainees and trainers (and training programs) are
indicators of whether or not teaching has been effective and learning has been achieved. Evaluations are also useful in monitoring
progress and providing feedback and guidance on how to enhance
the instruction and learning process. Outlined in the box on the
following page are elements that may be included in evaluations.
II. Mental Health Capacity Building
31
Elements of Training Evaluations
The following information can be useful in monitoring and determining the effectiveness of trainings:
1) Trainee evaluation
Trainee name (use ID numbers for confidentiality)
Trainee level of education/experience in MH care
Dates of participation and completion of coursework
list of all sessions/courses completed
list of courses repeated
theoretical & practical examination scores
theoretical & practical re-examination scores
2) Trainer & program/course/session evaluation
trainee survey evaluating quality of teaching, coursework, and examinations (was
trainer an effective speaker/communicator; were topics clear; were teaching aids
adequate; did exam questions reflect material presented, etc…)
 3) Program/course/session evaluation
total trainee enrollment
number of trainees with successful completion of the program
trainee attrition (number of drop-outs before completion of the program)
number of trainees requiring repetition of coursework/re-examination
progress/clinical outcome (condition of patients treated by trainees at the start of
treatment compared to their condition at the end of treatment )
patient/community survey evaluating services provided by trainees

HOW TO DEVELOP COLLABORATIONS
Cultures and societies throughout the world and throughout time
have found ways to describe and manage human emotions and
behavior. Some societies have created organized systems of mental health care while others have adopted different approaches.
Collaboration implies a coexistence among systems and approaches with each contributing its own unique methods for managing the health of individuals. The advantage of a health care
system that utilizes collaboration is that varied options for care
become available, increasing the potential for effective outcomes.
Ways that practitioners from different health systems develop collaborations
a) Invitations to consultations;
b) Cross-referral - For example, some problems may potentially be
better treated by one form of medicine compared to another
(e.g. stress, anxiety, bereavement, conversion reactions, and
existential distress may be managed with significant effect by
non-allopathic practitioners, while allopathic practitioners may
be have more effective treatments for severe mental disorders
and epilepsy);
c) Joint assessments;
d) Joint training sessions;
e) Joint clinics;
f) Shared care (e.g. non-allopathic practitioners may be prepared to
learn how to monitor psychotic patients on long-term allopathic medication and to provide places for patients to stay
while receiving allopathic treatments).
II. Mental Health Capacity Building
33
Advantages of collaboration
a) Increased understanding of the way emotional distress and psychiatric illness is expressed and addressed and a more comprehensive picture of the type and level of distress in the affected population;
b) Improved referral systems;
c) Continuing relationship with healers of varied types to whom
many people turn for help;
d) Increased understanding of community members’ spiritual, psychological and social worlds;
e) Greater acceptance of new services by community members;
f) Identifying opportunities for potential collaborative efforts in
healing and thus increasing the number of potentially effective
treatments available to the population;
g) Establishing services that may be more culturally appropriate;
h) The potential opportunity to monitor and address any human
rights abuses occurring within different systems of care.
Activities Prior to Collaboration
Before pursuing collaboration in an unfamiliar setting, the healthcare provider should first develop (as best as possible) an understanding of the national policies and attitudes regarding various
types of practitioners. For example, some governments discourage
or ban health care providers from collaborating with traditional
healers. Other governments encourage collaboration and have
special departments engaged in the formal training of healers, as
well as in research and evaluation of traditional medicine.
II. Mental Health Capacity Building
34
Organizing Collaborations
To facilitate collaboration, the healthcare provider should make an
assessment of the other systems of care present in the community.
This may be difficult for providers who are outsiders to the community. Being respectful and establishing trust with members of
the community is very important. Outlined below are suggestions
on how to obtain information about other systems.
a) Contact local community members who are a diverse sample of
the community if possible (i.e. speak to women, men, elderly/
adolescent individuals, members of different ethnicities, etc…).
Ask them where they seek help for mental health difficulties and
whom they use for emotional support.
b) Ask primary health care providers and midwives what systems
exist, including pharmacies.
c) Ask the people encountered in the health facilities how they
perceive their problems, and who else they see or have seen previously for assistance.
d) Contact local religious leaders and ask whether they provide
supportive or healing services and who else in the community does
so.
e) Use the help of community representatives or providers to organize a meeting with the local practitioners.
f) Remember that more than one system of care may exist, and that
practitioners in one system may not acknowledge or discuss others.
g) Be aware that within a community, local practitioners may compete over patients or be in conflict over the appropriate approach.
II. Mental Health Capacity Building
35
It is important next to establish a rapport and ongoing dialogue
with the practitioners. Encouraging and actively organizing forums for information-sharing and cross-training is important. A
variety of practitioners should play a role in the trainings and discussions about practical administrative issues, such as creating a
cross- referral process should be included on agendas. After a series of effective trainings has occurred, consider organizing specific collaborative services where needed (if possible).
A Caution Regarding Some Healing Practices
It should be noted that some healing practices may be harmful,
since they include beatings, prolonged fasting, cutting, prolonged
physical restraint or expulsion of ‘witches’ from the community.
The challenge in such cases is to find constructive ways of addressing harmful practices, as far as is realistic. Before supporting
or collaborating with any healing practice, it is essential to determine what those practices include and whether they are potentially
beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Sometimes maintaining a respectful distance is the best option, rather than seeking collaboration.

PART III. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS & ISSUES:
Identification and Interventions
OVERVIEW
The allopathic (western) medical system represents one approach
to dealing with mental health issues and managing mental health
conditions. Allopathic mental health care may be described as a
system of care in which staff has been trained in medical science,
behavioral science, formal psychotherapy and provides services in
inpatient hospitals, outpatient clinics, and other community facilities. This system of care is one form of support that is used today,
commonly in high-income societies. Non-allopathic types of care
may include traditional, indigenous, complementary, alternative,
informal, and local medicine and in some countries are utilized as
a primary or complementary means of care. These systems may
involve the use of animal or mineral based medicines, religious or
spiritual interventions, and manual techniques, either singularly or
in combination.
Presented in this part of the guidebook is an allopathic approach to
managing various mental health conditions. Basic theoretical concepts, counseling interventions, and medication therapies are described.
III. Conditions & Issues: How to Identify Symptoms
39
HOW TO IDENTIFY PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS
Descriptions of mental health and illness
Someone with a “healthy mind” has clear thoughts, the ability to
solve the problems of daily life, enjoys good relationships with
friends, family, and work colleagues, is spiritually at ease, and can
bring happiness to others (V.Patel 2002).
Mental illness can be defined as any illness experienced by a person which affects their emotions, thoughts or behavior, is out of
keeping with their cultural beliefs and personality, and produces a
negative effect on their lives or the lives of their families. Symptoms of illness can appear in the form of persistent changes in
mood, perception of reality, or capacity to organize or maintain
thoughts. Such changes will interfere with the person’s usual beliefs, personality or social function.
The psychiatric history & mental status examination (MSE) are
tools used to identify psychological distress and symptoms of illness. Information and observations obtained can be used to guide
the healthcare provider’s impressions and therapeutic interventions.
III. Conditions & Issues: How to Identify Symptoms
40
The Psychiatric History
Psychological distress and mental illness may be influenced by
past and present experiences and circumstances. A psychiatric
history is a description of the habits, activities, relationships, and
physical conditions that have shaped the way one feels, thinks, and
behaves. The psychiatric history is obtained by interviewing the
individual or asking a series of questions associated with their psychological function. Outlined below are the standard elements of
the psychiatric history.
Elements of the Psychiatric History
1) Identifying data – name, age, race, sex.
2) Chief complaint – a concise statement of the patient’s psychiatric problem in his or her own words.
3) History of present illness – current circumstances in which
current psychiatric symptoms have occurred.
4) Previous psychiatric history – any prior psychiatric symptoms, treatment (therapy or medication); prior psychiatric hospitalizations.
5) Medical history – history of significant medical conditions,
treatments/surgeries; current medications; history of allergies to
medications or other agents; history of head injuries; seizures; loss
of consciousness or other neurological disorders.
III. Conditions & Issues: How to Identify Symptoms
41
6) Family psychiatric history – any blood relatives with history
of psychiatric symptoms, treatment, or psychiatric hospitalizations.
7) History of alcohol or drug abuse or dependence – length or
period of abuse/dependence; date and amount of last use; history
of drug treatment or rehabilitation programs.
8) Social history – place of birth; description of family members; marital status; education obtained; occupations past and present.
The Mental Status Examination
 The purpose of the MSE is to assess the individual’s current emotional state and capacity for mental function. The mental status
examination is an organized systematic framework for noting observations that are made while interviewing individuals. In general, it involves categorizing observations in terms of behavior and
appearance; thought, feelings, judgment, insight, and other functions such as memory and concentration.
III. Conditions & Issues: How to Identify Symptoms
42
Elements of the Mental Status Examination (MSE)
1) General Appearance – e.g. gait; grooming;
posture.
 2) Motoric behavior (i.e. physical movements)–e.g. physical
agitation or retardation; tremors; anxiety.
 3) Speech – e.g. slow; rapid; loud; soft/inaudible; stuttering;
slurring; paucity; over-inclusive.
 4) Attitude –e.g. cooperative; irritable; angry; aggressive; defensive; guarded; apathetic.
 5) Mood – e.g. sad; happy; irritable; angry; elevated or expansive.
 6) Affect or facial expression – e.g. congruent or incongruent
with mood; flat; blunted; fluctuating.
 7) Thought content – e.g. delusions (persistent belief that is
inconsistent with reality), paranoia; suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
 8) Thought processing – e.g. logical/illogical; repetitive; disjointed; tendency to go on tangent; concrete. Decelerated; slowed;
rapid succession of ideas.
 9) Perception – e.g. auditory, visual, tactile, or olfactory hallucinations.
 10) Judgment – e.g. ability to understand relationships between
facts and to draw appropriate conclusions.
 11) Insight – e.g. is the patient able or willing to understand his
or her condition?
III. Conditions & Issues: How to Identify Symptoms
43
 12) Cognition
 a) level of consciousness – e.g. alert; cloudy; confused.
 b) orientation - i.e. to self, place, date, time.
 c) memory – i.e. long-term (events of the past such as place of
birth; date of marriage or graduations); recent (events of yesterday
or last week); short-term (test recall of 3 items after a period of 5
minutes).
 d) concentration or attention (serial 7 test – start at 100 and
count backwards by 7).
 e) executive function or ability to reason – test using abstraction tasks (e.g. ask how are an apple and banana similar? Ask individual to interpret a proverb appropriate to culture); test naming or
word finding skill (e.g. can the individual name different parts of a
watch/time-piece ).
 f) visual-motor coordination, in basic terms, may be defined
as the brain’s ability to coordinate information perceived by a sensory organ (the eyes) with complex motor functions (such as writing). Visual-motor coordination is tested by asking the individual
to draw an object or figure visualized. For example, draw a circle
that is connected to a rectangle and ask the individual to copy the
figure. An inability to copy the figure accurately may be an indication of conditions such as brain damage due to medical disease
or drug abuse (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease; alcohol dementia;),
schizophrenia, or mental retardation.
III: Conditions & Issues: Psychotic Conditions
45
PSYCHOTIC CONDITIONS:
Schizophrenia & Other Psychotic Conditions
The term “psychosis” has been used to describe individuals
who misinterpret reality or experience and express distortions
(out of the realm of reality) in perception, thought, and feeling. Distortions may lead to disruption in function with family, friends at school, or at work. Some psychotic conditions
may run in families and their specific causes are not fully
understood while other psychotic conditions are due to medical conditions or substances affecting the mental state.
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder that may be characterized
by a decline in motivation, socialization and function, diminished emotional expression, disorganized or abnormal motor
behavior (i.e. physical movement) and distorted sense of reality (with disturbances in perception and/or the expression of
thought). Worldwide prevalence estimates have ranged between 0.5% and 1%. Theories regarding the cause have been
proposed and have included a genetic, biological, psychosocial, and infectious basis for the disease. Schizophrenia has
been described in many cultures.
III: Conditions & Issues: Psychotic Conditions
46
Signs/Characteristics of Schizophrenia
* Decline in level of function and ability to socialize (this
can be expressed as withdrawal, detachment or isolation from others; this may also be expressed as aggression).
* Thoughts are expressed in an impaired or illogical manner
(i.e. incoherence; one may appear to have long pauses,
a “blank” or a lapse in thought; one may easily or repeatedly lose the point in conversation; thoughts are
disjointed with the association between thoughts being
lost).
* Delusional thought (thoughts that are inconsistent with
reality and persistently maintained).
* Impaired perception (hallucinations – auditory hallucinations or hearing people or things that are not physically
present are the most common in schizophrenia; visual
hallucinations or hallucinations of taste, touch, and
smell may occur but are less common).
* Diminished or incongruent emotional expressions
(appearing expressionless; crying easily over things that
are not typically sad); abnormal physical movement
(catatonia).
* Altered motivation (ambivalence about doing activities or
complete loss of motivation for activities).
* Symptoms persist (for at least 6 months ) and are not due
to a medical condition or substance abuse.
III: Conditions & Issues: Psychotic Conditions
47
Other Psychotic Conditions (DSM V/ US classification system)
Aside from schizophrenia, psychosis may occur due to other
conditions including delusional disorder (delusion is the
prominent symptom); schizophreniform (schizophrenia-like
symptoms for < 6 months); schizo-affective disorder ( both
mood and psychotic symptoms are prominent); brief psychosis
(psychotic symptoms<1 month); post partum psychosis
(psychotic symptoms after giving birth); and psychosis secondary to psychoactive substances or medical conditions.
Counseling Interventions For Schizophrenia & Other Psychotic Conditions
1. Outline a weekly schedule with the individual. A structured
routine helps one to know what to do and expect - this can
reduce the stress and anxiety that can precipitate symptoms.
Clearly list the core activities of daily living (showering, shaving, dressing, supply shopping, food preparation, cleaning) so
that basic self-care skills are maintained. Include chores so
that a sense of responsibility is maintained. Include pleasure
activities. Be sure there is a good balance between indoor and
outdoor activities. Also be sure to incorporate activities that
involve social interaction.
2. Reward constructive actions. Determine the items or situations that the patient values and reward him/her with them
when appropriate behavior is displayed (e.g. offer a valued
reward for having completed all chores and activities of daily
living adequately).
III: Conditions & Issues: Psychotic Conditions
48
3. Help the individual identify situations that cause stress or
anxiety as these can be triggers for a relapse of illness. Help
the individual limit involvement in these situations. If the
situation is unavoidable, help the individual think in advance
about what may occur and how he/she will respond.
4. Emphasize medication compliance. Discuss with the doctor
medication options and regimens that will make taking pills
easy.
5. Ask the health provider to explain the kind of side effects
that might be expected and what to do about them.
6. Emphasize keeping track of appointments. Missed appointments and doses of medicine can put the patient at risk for a
return of illness.
7. Educate family or caretakers. Educate that agitation or odd
behavior are symptoms of schizophrenia and are not intentional. Relapse is possible and should be anticipated. Review
the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia.
Medication Therapy
See the “Medication Guide” section of the manual for details
on medication therapy.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mood-Related Conditions
49
MOOD –RELATED CONDITIONS:
Major Depression & Bipolar Disorder
Major Depression
Depression has been generally described as a decline in mood
that persists for an extended period, represents a decrease from a
previous level of function, and causes some impairment in function. Depression contributes significantly to the global burden
of disease affecting an estimated 350 million people worldwide.
According to the World Mental Health Survey (conducted in 17
countries) approximately 1 in 20 people on average reported an
episode of depression in the previous year. In many cultures
depression is expressed commonly as somatic or physical complaints (e.g. fatigue, generalized pain, digestive problems, headache). Psychotic symptoms may also occur. Other signs and
characteristics of depression are outlined below.
Signs & Characteristics
- Persistent depressed mood and loss of pleasure in activities
that normally give pleasure;
- weight loss or gain;
- insomnia (i.e. too little sleep) or hypersomnia (i.e. too much
sleep);
- psychomotor agitation (i.e. agitated movement) or retardation
(i.e. slowed movement); energy loss;
- feelings of worthlessness or guilt;
- poor concentration or memory; indecisiveness;
- hopelessness or suicidal thoughts with the intention to act or
with specific plans made;
III: Conditions & Issues: Mood-Related Conditions
50
- symptoms are not due to a medical condition or substance capable of influencing the central nervous system.
Studies have indicated that biological, genetic, and psychosocial
factors play a role in depression. Biological factors include disturbances in neurotransmitters (molecules mediating communication between brain cells), abnormal immune system function,
and abnormal regulation of hormones. Genetic causes have been
implicated through studies of patterns of illness in families (e.g.
first degree relatives, twins) and studies of genetic material.
Psychosocial factors (life events and environmental stressors)
have been suggested as an influence as well. Depression may be
diagnosed through psychiatric history, mental status examination and eliminating other causes with laboratory or other diagnostic tests. Depression is treated with counseling interventions
and, in severe cases, medication.
Counseling Interventions for Depression
If symptoms are persistent and severe, refer to a crisis center/
doctor/hospital for further evaluation, diagnosis, & treatment.
Offer support: emphasize that there is no shame in feeling depressed; help the individual identify others who can serve as a
support (family, friends); help him/her identify & focus on personal strengths and the positives in a challenging situation; help
him/her identify & focus on what they can control; ask about
hopeless and suicidal feelings and the intent to act on these feelings.
Medication Therapy
See the “Medication Guide” section of the manual for details on
medication therapy.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mood-Related Conditions
51
Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder is a type of mood disorder characterized by
distinct phases of sustained depression and/or distinct periods of
a mood which is persistent and abnormally elevated, expansive ,
or irritable. Psychosis may be present also in either phase. According to research analyzing World Health Organization
(WHO) mental health survey data, the prevalence rates for bipolar spectrum disorder (BPS) worldwide vary, but illness severity
and patterns of co-morbidity are similar.
The table below outlines important features of the most severe
form of bipolar disorder, bipolar type I disorder.

behavior

Depressive Phase: depressive symptoms satisfy criteria for a full major depressive
episode (SEE DEPRESSION
SECTION OF THIS CHAPTER FOR SPECIFIC
SYMPTOMS)

Symptoms are
identified through
mental status examination (MSE);

Rule out substance
and medical causes
via diagnostic tests if
available (i.e. toxicology screens,
thyroid function
tests, chemistries,
CBC, brain imaging)

III: Conditions & Issues: Mood-Related Conditions
52
Other Types of Bipolar Disorders
1) Bipolar II – presence of at least one major depressive
episode and one hypomanic (i.e. less severely manic)
episode. No manic episode has occurred. The criteria
for a hypomanic episode is the same as for a manic
episode except that in a hypomanic episode the symptoms do not cause significant impairment in social or
occupational function. Psychosis may occur with this
condition.

2) Substance/Medication induced Bipolar Disorder - persistent and prominent elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood (with or without depressive symptoms) that occurs in the context of using a substance or medication
which can cause bipolar symptoms. The disturbance
causes significant distress or impaired function. The
disturbance does not occur during a period of delirium.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mood-Related Conditions
53
Counseling interventions for Mania/Bipolar Disorder
1. Educate the family/caretakers. Educate the family and patient
that agitation, mood fluctuation, and impulsivity are common
symptoms of bipolar disorder and are not intentional. Relapse is
possible and should be anticipated. Review with them the signs
and symptoms of bipolar disorder. Emphasize the importance of
medication compliance.
2. Emphasize medication compliance. Discuss with the doctor
medication options and regimens that will make taking pills easy
(e.g. use of pill organizer boxes; explore whether once a day
dosing is appropriate and possible).
3. Reward constructive actions. Determine the items or situations that the patient values and reward him/her with them when
appropriate behavior is displayed (e.g. offer a valued reward for
having contained impulsive behaviors).
4. Encourage a routine schedule. Outline a weekly schedule with
the individual. A structured routine helps one to know what to
do and expect and helps to reduce the stress and anxiety that can
precipitate symptoms.
5. Help the individual identify situations that cause stress or
anxiety as these can be triggers for a relapse of illness. Help the
individual limit involvement in these situations. If a stressful
situation is unavoidable, help the patient think in advance about
what may occur and how he/she will respond. Breathing and
relaxation exercises can reduce anxiety felt in these situations
(see chapter on “Anxiety Conditions” for breathing and relaxation exercises).
6. Emphasize keeping track of appointments. Missed appointments can lead to the individual’s running out of medication.
Missing doses of medicine can put the individual at risk for a
return of symptoms and a relapse of illness.

ANXIETY-RELATED CONDITIONS, OBSESSIVECOMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) & POST-TRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER (PTSD)
Anxiety may be defined as a state of neurological arousal characterized
by both physical and psychological signs. Anxiety may be a normal
reaction that acts as a signal to the body that aspects of its systems are
under stress. Prevalence estimates of anxiety disorders are generally
higher in developed countries than in developing countries according to
global mental health survey data. The specific neuro-biological mechanisms underlying anxiety are complex and may involve genetic, biological, and psychological factors. Common signs of anxiety are outlined in
the table below:
Physical signs Psychological signs
Headache
Muscle tension
Back pain
Abdominal pain
Tremulousness or “shakiness”
Fatigue
Numbness
Shortness of breath
Palpitations
Sweating
Hyper-vigilant reflexes (easily startled; “jumpy”)
Feeling of dread
Poor concentration
Impaired sleep
Impaired sexual desire
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &
PTSD
56
Anxiety “disorders” are considered when the signals triggered by the
body produce prolonged physical or psychological discomfort or a pattern and degree of distress that disrupts normal function. An anxiety
disorder is considered if no underlying medical illness, substance intoxication (or withdrawal), medication toxicity, or toxicity of other agents
can be identified as the cause. Types of anxiety disorders, obsessivecompulsive disorder or OCD, and post-traumatic stress disorder or
PTSD (described in western literature/DSM-V) are outlined below.
1. Anxiety-Related Disorders (Anxiety Disorders)
A) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
GAD is defined as chronic, constant anxiety that persists throughout the
day consistently for at least 1 month.
B) Panic Disorder
Panic disorder involves a sudden, spontaneous onset of overwhelming
anxiety symptoms.
C) Agoraphobia
Agoraphobia involves experiencing anxiety and fear in the context of
feeling unable to escape in situations such as being in open or enclosed
spaces, of being alone outside the home, or of being in a crowd, or using
public transportation.
D) Phobia
An irrational fear of a particular object or situation causing anxiety
symptoms.
E) Social Phobia/Social Anxiety Disorder
Specific irrational fear/discomfort in social or public situations.
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &
PTSD
57
2. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
The presence of obsessions (i.e. constant intrusive thoughts or urges
causing anxiety symptoms) and/or compulsions (i.e. unusual and excessive behaviors or mental acts one is compelled to perform repetitively in
order to reduce anxiety to a dreaded situation or event).
3. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) & Acute Stress Disorder
Anxiety occurs in the context of an overwhelming major life stressor.
The stressful event is continuously re-experienced (during dreams or
wakefulness) causing hyper-arousal and a tendency toward avoidance. If
symptoms persist for greater than 1 month PTSD is indicated; if symptoms persist for less than 1 month, acute stress disorder is diagnosed.
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &

58
Counseling Interventions: Exercises for Anxiety-Related Conditions, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD)
A) Breathing Exercise
(May be especially useful for panic; agoraphobia; generalized anxiety;
phobias; social phobia/anxiety; post-traumatic & acute stress).
Shortness of breath is a common feeling that many people get when anxious. When one feels out of breath the natural tendency is to breathe in
more or faster. This can lead to hyperventilation which can make anxiety
worse.
An effective way to manage abnormal breathing when anxious is to do the
following:
 Breathe in slowly to the count of three.
 Breathe using your abdomen instead of the chest.
 When you get to three, slowly breathe out to the count of three seconds.
 Pause for three seconds then breath in again for 3 seconds.
 Continue this exercise for five minutes.
 Practice twice a day.
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &
PTSD
59
B) Muscle relaxation exercise
(May be especially useful for panic; agoraphobia; generalized anxiety;
social anxiety; post-traumatic & acute stress).
For each of the muscle groups in your body, tense the muscles for 5–10
seconds, then relax for 10 seconds. Only tense your muscles moderately
(not to the point of inducing pain). Don’t force the release of the muscle
tension - simply let go of the tension in your muscles and allow them to
become relaxed. Relax your muscles in the following order:
Hands — clench one fist tightly, then relax. Do the same with the other
hand.
Lower arms — bend your hand down at the wrist, as though you were
trying to touch the underside of your arm, then relax.
Upper arms — bend your elbows and tense your arms. Feel the tension
in your upper arm, then relax.
Shoulders — lift your shoulders up as if trying to touch your ears with
them, then relax.
Neck — stretch your neck gently to the left, then forward, then to the
right, then to the back in a slow rolling motion, then relax.
Forehead and scalp — raise your eyebrows, then relax.
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &
PTSD
60
Eyes — look about, rotating your eyes, then relax.
Jaw — clench your teeth (just to tighten the muscles), then relax.
Tongue — press your tongue against the roof of your mouth, then relax.
Chest — breathe in deeply to inflate your lungs, then breath out and relax.
Stomach — suck your tummy in to tighten the muscle, then relax.
Upper back — pull your shoulders forward with your arms at your side,
then relax.
Lower back — while sitting, lean your head and upper back forward,
rolling your back into a smooth arc thus tensing the lower back, then
relax.
Buttocks — tighten your buttocks, then relax.
Thighs — while sitting, push your feet firmly into the floor, then relax.
Calves — lift your toes off the ground towards your shins, then relax.
Feet — gently curl your toes down so that they are pressing into the
floor, then relax.
Enjoy the feeling of relaxation: Take some slow breaths while you sit
still for a few minutes, enjoying the feeling of relaxation.
Practice once or twice a day. During the day, try relaxing specific muscles whenever you notice that they are tense.
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &
PTSD
61
C) Problem-solving exercise
(May be especially useful for generalized anxiety & social anxiety).
Choose one or two problems that are particularly bothersome and make a
decision to try to resolve them as best as possible.
1. On a sheet of paper, list the specific problems.
2. List five or six possible solutions to the problem. Write down any
ideas that occur to you, not merely the ‘good’ ideas.
3. Evaluate the positive and negative points of each idea.
4. Choose the solution that best fits your needs.
5. Plan exactly the steps you will take to put the solution into action.
6. Review your efforts after attempting to carry out the plan. Praise all
efforts. If unsuccessful, start again.
D) Managing negative, distorted thinking
(May be especially useful for generalized anxiety; social anxiety; & obsessive -compulsive disorder).
Significant anxiety can influence thoughts and emotions and progress to
negative, pessimistic feelings and even irrational, distorted thoughts.
Management of negative distorted thoughts involves:
 Identifying the negative, distorted thoughts
 Substituting these thoughts with more realistic ideas (create a list of
alternative thoughts that are realistic, positive and counter each
negative thought listed). This is an important skill that can help reduce anxiety symptoms.
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &
PTSD
62
E) Graded exposure (Gradual exposure to feared objects or situations). The relevance of the examples listed will vary among different cultures and societies.
This may be particularly useful for phobias. It incorporates the breathing
and relaxation exercises as well. The key strategy for overcoming fears of
this kind involves creating a plan or hierarchy of steps. The individual is
gradually exposed to the fearful object or situation, in small steps, so that
eventually less anxiety is experienced when the object or situation is present. For example, a woman refuses to go on a public bus fearing that it
will have an accident. However, she must use a bus to get to work and run
important errands such as going to the market.
First – teach the breathing and relaxation exercises to the individual since
these techniques will be important in reducing the anxiety felt during moments when an aspect of the frightening object or situation is present.
Second – clearly outline with the individual the steps of the exposure process:
 Start with a picture of the frightening object (bus).
 Look at pictures of a bus or take a trip to a bus stop without actually
getting on the bus.
 Take a very brief bus ride (1 or 2 stops).
 Increase the amount of time on the bus.
III: Conditions & Issues: Anxiety-Related Conditions, OCD, &
PTSD
63
During each step, the individual should be expressing his/her feelings,
using breathing and relaxation to control anxiety occurring in the moment.
In separate sessions, use the exercise in “Managing Negative, Distorted
Thinking” to correct thought distortions, misconceptions or fears about
the object or situation.

 III: Conditions & Issues: Somatic Symptom Disorder & Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions
65
Somatic Symptom Disorder & Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions
Somatic Symptom Disorder
Signs/characteristics
Given the connection between the mind (brain) and body, it is
possible for individuals to express emotional distress as physical
(somatic) symptoms. A somatic symptom disorder should be
considered if one is excessively and persistently preoccupied
with physical symptoms such that daily life and function are
adversely affected.
Individuals with somatic symptom disorder may present with
excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with somatic symptoms. Constant anxiety about symptoms or health in
general may be present, the seriousness of symptoms may be
exaggerated and persistently emphasized, and excessive time
and energy are spent focused on the symptoms. One somatic
symptom (particularly pain ) or more may be experienced and
symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical
condition. In severe cases, individuals may repeatedly visit
health services, have a tendency to request only symptom relief,
and have little ability to accept that no physical illness is present
when diagnostic testing is unremarkable.
US studies have indicated that the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is 5%-7% in the general adult population and females tend to report more somatic symptoms than do males. In
addition, somatic symptom disorder is related to high rates of co
-morbid conditions including anxiety, depression, and medical
disorders.
 III: Conditions & Issues: Somatic Symptom Disorder & Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions
66
Counseling Interventions For Somatic Symptom Disorder
General considerations:
 Acknowledge that the individual’s complaints are
real but avoid recommending unnecessary or new
medications for each new symptom if examinations and diagnostic tests are unremarkable.
 Ask the individual’s opinion about potential causes
of symptoms.
 Support the concept of wellness rather than a focus
on symptoms and illness.
 Discuss emotional stress that may have accompanied symptoms originally. Explain that stress may
be related to the physical symptoms experienced.
A brief respite may be helpful for individuals complaining in relation to recent stress. If indicated,
offer relaxation methods that can decrease tension.
 For individuals with chronic complaints schedule
regular, time-limited appointments with the same
clinician if possible.
 III: Conditions & Issues: Somatic Symptom Disorder & Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions
67
Exercise
For individuals who have some insight about the connection between their emotions and physical complaints the
following technique may be useful.
1. Have the individual list his/her physical complaints,
severity of the complaints, activities involved in as physical problems are experienced, and the emotions that are
occurring as the physical problems are experienced:
2. Explore with the individual, the possible connection
between the physical complaint and emotions experienced.
3. Discuss possible ways to adjust the activities so that
emotional distress is reduced (i.e. changing the day or
time of day to a time when there are no other chores to
do; reducing the amount done at one time in order to
have more free time; using the help of others; incorporating a pleasurable activity into a trip to the market; praising and rewarding oneself for the efforts).

Medication Therapy for Somatic Symptom Disorder
1. Treatment of underlying/co-existing medical conditions is important.
2. Antidepressant and/or anti-anxiety medications for underlying/coexisting depression and/or anxiety is recommended.
See the “Medication Guide “ section of the manual for medication therapy for depression and anxiety conditions.
 III: Conditions & Issues: Somatic Symptom Disorder & Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions
69
Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions
Signs/Characteristics
Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions involve the presence of one or more psychological or behavioral factors that negatively affect a medical condition by
precipitating, exacerbating or increasing the severity and/or
extent of illness (e.g. increased asthma symptoms after experiencing stress). Psychological/behavioral factors may
include depression, anxiety, stressful life events, and maladaptive personality traits, coping style, and relationship
style.
Counseling Interventions & Medication Therapy
Treatment involves stabilization of any medical symptoms
present, use of anti-anxiety and antidepressant medication for
co-existing anxiety disorders or depression, counseling, and
psychotherapy.
Counseling interventions

III: Conditions & Issues: Substance Use Disorders
71
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS
Signs/Characteristics
A) Definitions regarding psychoactive substances (i.e. substances that
activate the brain and cause effects on thoughts, emotions, and behaviors).
1. Intoxication – maladaptive behavior associated with recent drug
ingestion.
2. Withdrawal – adverse physical & psychological symptoms that occur following cessation of the drug.
3. Tolerance – the need for more substance to attain the same level of
effect.
4. Abuse or Misuse – a maladaptive pattern of use leading to repetitive
problems and negative consequences (i.e. use in dangerous situations
such as driving; use leading to legal, social and occupational problems).
III: Conditions & Issues: Substance Use Disorders
72
5. Dependence (addiction) — continued desire for and use of a psychoactive substance to satisfy pleasurable urges and/or to alleviate the
effects of withdrawal. Dependence may be psychological or physical
in nature.
Psychological dependence:
 Persistent substance use, despite evidence of its harmful consequences.
 Difficulties in controlling the use of the substance.
 Neglect of interests and an increased amount of time taken to
obtain the substance or recover from its effects.
 Evidence of tolerance such that higher doses are required to
achieve the same effect.
 Compulsion or craving: a strong desire to take the substance.
 Anxiety or mood disturbance occurs if drug is not taken.
Physical dependence:
 Physical symptoms occur if drug is not taken (e.g. headache;
gastrointestinal distress; changes in blood pressure, heart rate;
sweating; tremors; muscular pain).
III: Conditions & Issues: Substance Use Disorders
73
B) Effects of Selected Psychoactive Substances
Alcohol
Worldwide, alcohol consumption and problems related to alcohol vary
widely, but , in most countries, the burden of disease and death remains significant. Alcohol consumption is the world’s third largest risk
factor for disease and disability behind high blood pressure (first) and
smoking (second). In middle-income countries, it is the greatest risk.
The world’s highest alcohol consumption levels are found in developed countries.
Intoxication Symptoms: Slurred speech; unstable walking; mood
change; aggression; anxiety; psychosis; sleep disturbance; and delirium.
Withdrawal Symptoms (occurring several hours to a few days after
cessation of use that has been heavy and prolonged): Nausea; headache; nystagmus (rapid horizontal movement of eyeballs); unstable
blood pressure or heart rate; psychosis; anxiety; mood disturbance;
sleep disturbance; delirium; and seizure.
III: Conditions & Issues: Substance Use Disorders
74
Cannabis
Worldwide, cannabis ( with a global annual prevalence ranging from
2.6 to 5.0 per cent) remains the most widely used illicit drug according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) 2012
report.
Intoxication Symptoms: Elevated or depressed mood; anxiety; inappropriate laughing; paranoia; hallucinations; red eyes; increased appetite; dry mouth; increased heart rate.
Studies have indicated an association between high doses of cannabis
and delirium, panic, ongoing psychosis may occur. In addition, Longterm use has been linked to anxiety, depression, and loss of motivation.
Withdrawal Symptoms (occurring 1 week after cessation of prolonged, heavy use, i.e. a few months of daily or near daily use): Depressed or irritable mood; anxiety; restlessness; sleep disturbance;
poor appetite; and weight loss.
III: Conditions & Issues: Substance Use Disorders
75
C) Interventions for Substance Use Disorders
 Refer to medical evaluation, diagnosis, & medical stabilization as
indicated.
 Assess for underlying psychiatric conditions (e.g. depression,
anxiety).
 Refer to drug counseling program if available or psychological
services for treatment.
Additional Counseling Interventions For Substance Use Disorders
1. Anxiety and depression may underlie substance abuse. Also, some
individuals with bipolar disorder or a psychotic disorder may use alcohol or drugs to self-medicate or deal with symptoms. It is therefore
important to evaluate for these psychiatric conditions and provide or
refer to the appropriate treatments. For some individuals, drug and
alcohol use is decreased if underlying anxiety, mood disturbance, or
other distress is relieved.
2. Teach breathing and relaxation techniques as a means for controlling anxiety (see chapter on “Anxiety Disorders” for technique instructions).
3. Encourage individuals to identify people who can be contacted for
support when cravings or distress occurs. Another who is also recovering from addiction and is sober can be a good ally.

III: Conditions & Issues: Delirium & Dementia
77
NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS:
DELIRIUM & DEMENTIA
The term “neurocognitive disorder” refers to a significant
decline from a previous level of function in one or more of
cognitive realms including awareness (orientation, consciousness), complex attention (sustained, selective, and divided attentions); executive function (planning, decision
making, mental flexibility); learning and memory; language;
perceptual-motor (visual perception and construction, integration of visual perception with movement); and social cognition (recognition of emotions, ability to consider other’s
mental state). Types of neurocognitive disorders include: 1)
delirium and 2) major & mild neurocognitive disorders
(dementia).
1) Delirium
Delirium is a disturbance particularly in the ability to focus,
sustain, or shift attention. Other characteristics of delirium
may include additional deficits in cognition (e.g. memory,
perception), rapid onset, a fluctuating course, reversiblility,
agitation, irritability, and psychosis (i.e. distortion of reality).
Causes of delirium may include brain disease, systemic disease (e.g. heart disease), drugs, medications, and other toxins.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms of delirium may be identified
through a thorough mental status examination. The underlying cause of disease may be identified, if resources are available, through a complete battery of laboratory and diagnostic
tests [e.g. blood chemistries, complete blood count, chest xray, urinalysis & toxicology, electrocardiogram (EKG), computerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain].
III: Conditions & Issues: Delirium & Dementia
78
2) Major/Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (Dementia)
Major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) may be difficult at times to differentiate from delirium, as there are a
number of shared characteristics, particularly cognitive
deficits (e.g. memory deficit). In general, a pervasive
cognitive and intellectual decline with a lack of impaired
awareness or consciousness is what distinguishes dementia from delirium. Other characteristics of the disorder
may include slow onset; an ongoing, continuous course;
irreversibility; agitation; irritability; depression; psychosis; and a gradual, permanent decline in function.
“Mild” neurocognitive disorder differs from the major
disorder in the degree of disturbance present. Cognitive
deficits are modest and do not interfere to a level where
independent function is significantly impaired.
Conditions causing neurocognitive disorder include Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration,
lewy body disease, vascular disease, brain trauma, brain
tumors, infections (e.g. HIV), alcoholism, drug abuse,
medications, other toxins, and poor oxygen supply.
A thorough mental status exam with particular attention
to the evaluation of cognitive function will elucidate
symptoms of major and mild neurocognitive disorder.
Laboratory and diagnostic tests can identify underlying
causes of disease.
III: Conditions & Issues: Delirium & Dementia
79
INTERVENTIONS
Patients identified as having symptoms of delirium or dementia should be referred to the hospital for further
evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment.
A) Delirium
· Adjust sensory stimulation as indicated (i.e. decrease
stimulation if the person is agitated; increase if the person
is sensory deprived).
· Place the person in an area that is safe and secure (no
dangerous objects or hazards nearby) and where he/she can
be observed easily.
B) Major/Mild Neurocognitive Disorders (Dementia)
· Arrange the environment so that there are clear cues for
orientation to date, time, place.
· Incorporate proper nutrition, exercise, & mentally stimulating activity.
· Provide support for the family (e.g. education, group
therapy).
 Aids to enhance function:
Memory aids: Calendars; organizers; outline routines for
daily activities; checklists; pill boxes; and timers.
Physical aids: Canes; wrist weights
Physical and mental stimulatory aids: Exercise such as
walking, stretching, ball throwing; identify/encourage previous hobbies; card/board games; puzzles; encourage storytelling, singing; Encourage time with others who will
stimulate (talkative friends).
III: Conditions & Issues: Delirium & Dementia
80
Medications
Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics are used with caution to treat severe agitation associated with delirium.
Antidepressants may be indicated for depressive symptoms associated with dementia. Elderly individuals with
dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic medications are at an increased risk of death (due
to infectious or cardiovascular conditions). HIV dementia may be treated and potentially reversed with antiretroviral therapy.
III: Conditions & Issues: Epilepsy
81
EPILEPSY
Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the brain affecting approximately 50 million people in the world, with nearly 80% of the
people with epilepsy found in developing countries. The condition is characterized by recurrent seizures (i.e. brief episodes of
involuntary shaking) which may involve a part of the body
(partial) or the entire body (generalized). Seizures are due to
excessive electrical discharges within a network of brain cells
and may be accompanied by loss of consciousness and control
of bowel or bladder function.
Signs/characteristics of Epilepsy
The cause of epilepsy in 70% of cases is unknown. Other
causes may include infection, brain injury, drugs/alcohol, vascular disease, or a nutrient imbalance. These conditions may
cause “seizures” or destabilization and abnormal stimulation of
nervous system cells. Seizures may be characterized as either
partial (localized) or generalized (global):
1) Partial (focal) seizure – originates in a localized area
and remains localized.
a) simple - consciousness is not affected (e.g. motor).
b) complex - some localized or specific areas of the
brain may have more complex associations and
function than other areas. Seizure activity within
these circuits may result in “complex-localized”
seizures.
III: Conditions & Issues: Epilepsy
82
 Complex-localized seizures may be characterized by
an “aura” or a set of abnormal sensory signals such
as light flashes, smells and noises that precede the
onset of a seizure. Consciousness may also be impaired with this type of seizure.
c) secondarily generalized – seizure spreads locally to
generally.
2) Generalized seizure– originates centrally and continues
generally (i.e. globally).
a) absence/petit mal (typical symptoms may include
staring; stop mid-sentence then continue). May be
typical or atypical in presentation.
b) tonic-clonic/grand mal (aura; all 4 limbs involved;
unconscious; incontinence; post-ictal confusion,
headache, or excessive sleep).
c) other generalized seizures include myoclonic
(involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles); clonic (involuntary rhythmic jerking); and
atonic (“drop attack” or lapse of muscle tone).
Psychiatric Manifestations
Change in personality is common while psychosis and violence
have been found to occur less frequently than previously perceived. Temporal lobe epilepsy has been associated with instability in mood.
III: Conditions & Issues: Epilepsy
83
Counseling Interventions For Epilepsy
1. Educate the family/caretakers. Review with them the signs
and symptoms of epilepsy. Provide guidance on what to do if
one has a seizure. Emphasize the importance of medication
compliance. Explain to parents that epilepsy has been associated with behavioral change and conduct disturbance in children and provide them with guidance on how to set limits and
reinforce constructive behaviors.
2. Help the individual identify situations that cause stress or
anxiety as these can be triggers for a relapse of illness. Help
the individual limit involvement in these situations or (if situation is unavoidable) help the individual think in advance about
what will occur and how he/she will respond. Breathing and
relaxation exercises can be incorporated to help reduce anxiety
felt in these situations (see chapter on Anxiety-Related Conditions for breathing and relaxation exercises).
3. Emphasize keeping track of appointments. Missed appointments can lead to the individual’s running out of medication.
Missing doses of medicine can put him/her at risk for a return
of symptoms and a relapse of illness.
4. Medication Compliance. The individual should discuss
with the doctor medication options and regimens that will
make taking pills easy (use pill organizer boxes; is once a day
dosing possible?).
Medication Therapy
See “Medication Guide” section of the guide.
III: Conditions & Issues: Sleep Disturbance
85
SLEEP DISTURBANCE
Signs/characteristics
A disturbance in sleep can occur as a part of or separately from a psychiatric condition. Studies from western cultures have indicated that
insomnia (decreased ability to sleep) is common and can have many
causes (e.g. as a primary condition or due to a secondary cause such
as medical illness, psychiatric conditions, medications, or drugs and
alcohol). Sleep disturbance is one of the commonest responses to
stress.
Counseling Interventions For Sleep Disturbance
Sleep hygiene (measures to create a regular sleep pattern)
1) Set a regular bedtime and make efforts to adhere to it even if
not tired.
2) Make efforts to arise at the same time each morning.
3) Avoid napping during the day.
4) Exercise during the day. Practice relaxation exercises in the
evening (e.g. meditation, yoga).
5) Ensure a comfortable sleep space.
6) Limit activating substances (e.g. caffeine, alcohol, nicotine);
none in the second half of the day is recommended.
7) Address any underlying medical or psychiatric disturbance.
III: Conditions & Issues: Sleep Disturbance
86
Medication Therapy
See “ Medication Guide” section of manual.
III: Conditions & Issues: Loss & Bereavement
87
LOSS & BEREAVEMENT
Signs/Characteristics
Grief is the name for the feelings accompanying the loss of any
loved person, place, or object. This can include one’s home,
one’s health (e.g. being diagnosed with a long term illness or
having a limb amputation) and one’s country or culture (e.g. being a refugee).
Loss and the process of grieving (bereavement) is complex and
will vary from one individual to the next. Emotional responses to
loss, death and dying have been described by Kubler-Ross and
include:
a) Denial – There is an inability to accept that the loss has occurred. This may be accompanied by a feeling of shock, surprise
and numbness. One cannot believe that such a thing could happen to him/her.
b) Anger – anger and hostility may be experienced. Blaming others or oneself for not preventing the loss is a common theme.
c) Bargaining – belief that if one acts or thinks differently the loss
can be retrieved (or in the case of dying, the loss can be avoided).
One may feel severe guilt (“Maybe this would not have happened
if I had been more attentive…”).
d) Depression or emotional breakdown – the reality of the loss
sets in. There can be feelings of unbearable loneliness, sadness,
loss of motivation and interest; the person may withdraw from
contact with others. Anxiety, panic, and thought disorganization
can occur. Emotional distress may also be expressed as agitation,
fatigue, impaired sleep, and impaired appetite.
III: Conditions & Issues: Loss & Bereavement
88
e) Acceptance – one is able ultimately to place the loss in perspective and move on to new activities and relationships.
Initially, it was believed that these reactions occurred in a linear, stage-like fashion, however, responses do not have to follow an established order. The feeling may occur in rapid succession or in combination (e.g. depression and anger). In addition, caregivers to dying individuals may also experience these
reactions.
A variety of factors may influence a person’s ability to manage
loss. These factors may include:
1. Age/emotional maturity.
2. Personality traits - capacity for resiliency, independence,
disappointment, patience.
3. Belief systems - What does this loss represent? How does
one view death – as a part of the life cycle or as a horrible
event to be avoided? One may believe that the spirit of a deceased loved one can live on through the memories maintained
by his/her survivors.
4. Psychological defense mechanisms - e.g. sublimating or neutralizing loss through humor or humanitarian actions.
5. Personal expectations.
6. Support system - family, friends, healthcare workers.
III: Conditions & Issues: Loss & Bereavement
89
Counseling Interventions
Individuals will vary in the way and degree to which they
grieve. People with prolonged distress or distress affecting
their function should be evaluated for major depression and
other psychological conditions.
The following general points may be useful in helping people
through the grieving process:
1. Ensure that normal culturally appropriate mourning processes have been able to take place.
2. Provide reassurance that the grieving process is normal despite the painful feelings it causes. Do not force talking. People choose their own times and situations to share feelings –
but make it clear that you can listen if they wish to share their
painful experiences and feelings.
3. Encourage finding simple ways to enjoy positive memories
of the past (e.g. through photographs and stories).
4. Provide reassurance that unbearable, painful feelings can
decrease over time.
5. Recommend adequate rest and exercise.
6. Help the individual understand that it is not unusual for people to experience dreams, nightmares, visions or desire to talk
to the dead.
III: Conditions & Issues: Loss & Bereavement
90
7. Recommend avoiding making large, complex decisions.
8. Help the individual be aware that there may be events or
circumstances when painful feelings about the loss are
triggered (e.g. birthdays, anniversaries, other deaths,
etc…). Being prepared for this will diminish the impact.
9. Help one understand that loss involves change and that
new activities or relationships may be a part of the change.
III: Conditions & Issues: Loss & Bereavement
91
Loss & Bereavement in Children
A) General
Children at different stages of development have different reactions to loss. Some individuals may develop an understanding
sooner or later than their peers, however, in general, children
begin to develop an understanding of the finality of death
around the age of five. Studies (western) indicate that children
who suffer an early bereavement have a higher incidence of
psychiatric disorders in later childhood. In addition, adults
who are bereaved of a parent in childhood are more vulnerable
to psychiatric disorders than the general population. When
additional losses are experienced, they may be more prone to
depression and anxiety than the general population.
B) Children Under Age 5
Under five, children do not understand the irreversibility of
death. Children under five generally demonstrate unrealistic or
“magical” thinking that results in misconceptions about causes
and effects. They also have an egocentric or self-centered view
of the world leading to a feeling of responsibility for a death
(e.g. “Mommy won’t come back because I was naughty…”).
Reactions are similar to those following any separation where
the longer the absence, the greater the distress. A child may
appear detached as though he or she does not care.
III: Conditions & Issues: Loss & Bereavement
92
C) Children Age 5 – 10years
After the age of five, children can understand that death is
irreversible, however, they still may not regard it as something that can affect them. They may continue to have
some magical, concrete, and egocentric thinking. Children
at this age have a concept of good and bad, become curious about cause and effect, and are able to articulate concern for others. Children may express the desire to stay
connected to the dead parent.

D) Age 10 - Adolescence
During this stage, children begin to develop an understanding of
abstract concepts regarding death (e.g. death is universal and
inevitable and can affect them personally). They also become
aware of inconsistencies and can experience the conflict between
concepts such as justice versus injustice and the desire for independence versus the need for closeness. Death can feel confusing and conflictual - individuals at this age may express feelings
of indifference, detachment, identification, or nostalgia. Additional common immediate reactions to death for children in this
age range are listed in the box below.
Common Immediate Reactions to Death/Loss (children age 10-
adolescence)
Shock & disbelief
Dismay and protest
Apathy and feeling stunned
Continuation of usual activities
Anxiety
Vivid memories
Sleep problems
Sadness and longing
Anger and acting out behavior
Guilt, self-reproach and shame
Physical complaints
School problems
Regressive behavior
Social isolation
Fantasies
Personality changes
Pessimism about the future

E) Guidelines for Managing Loss & Bereavement in Children
When a child has experienced a loss, it is best not to hide
the truth. Children need clear, honest, consistent explanations appropriate to their level of development. They need
to accept the reality of the loss not to be protected from it.
Magical thinking should be explored and corrected. What
is imagined may be worse than reality and children may be
blaming themselves for events beyond their control. Encourage a supportive environment where open communication is possible, difficult questions are answered, and
distressing feelings are tolerated. Allow children to express grief in a manner they find appropriate, to express to
the people they most trust and feel comfortable, and to
express at a time of their choosing.
If a child has lost a parent or significant caretakers, the
child will need to be provided consistent, enduring, appropriate care. The more continuity with the child’s previous
life, the better. Children may wish to avoid traumatic reminders, especially in the beginning, but complete removal
from a familiar environment may cause more pain and
problems in the long term. They should be reunited with
caring extended family if available.
III: Conditions & Issues: Loss & Bereavement
95
Loss & Bereavement in Disasters/Catastrophic Emergencies
A disaster or catastrophic emergency may be defined as a significant nature-related (e.g. earthquakes, tsunami, hurricanes,
floods, etc) or human-related event (e.g. armed conflict) that
directly threatens life or compromises the basic needs required
to sustain life (i.e. food, shelter, water & sanitation, security,
disease control, or access to health care). Losses and grief
under these circumstances can be devastating and overwhelming. There may be formal supportive efforts provided by various humanitarian organizations or less formal support by individuals and other neighboring communities.
For organizations lending aid, the Inter-agency Standing Committee (IASC) Task Force on Mental Health and Psychosocial
Support has developed guidelines for primary (acute phase)
and secondary/comprehensive (reconsolidation phase) social
and psychological interventions that may be useful in helping
individuals and communities recover constructively (see the
chapter, “An Approach to Care: Crisis Situations—Disaster/
Emergency Settings”).
III: Conditions & Issues: Maternal Mental Health
97
MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH
Maternal mental health disorders are a public health challenge
posing a significant personal, social, and economic burden on
women, their babies, their families, and society. Studies indicate
that depression and anxiety are about two times as prevalent
worldwide in women than in men and tend to occur at their highest rates during childbearing years (i.e. puberty to menopause).
The incidence of depression and anxiety is highest in the year
following delivery compared to during pregnancy or at a time of
no pregnancy. In developed countries, suicide is one of the most
common causes of maternal death during the year after delivery.
While psychosis post-partum is uncommon, in developing countries, rates may be higher (due to infection as a contributing factor).
Risk Factors for Developing Mental Health Disorders (during
pregnancy and in the first year following delivery)
1. poverty
2. extreme stress
3. exposure to domestic, gender-based, or sexual violence
4. limited social support network
5. natural disasters or emergency & conflict situations migration
III: Conditions & Issues: Maternal Mental Health
98
Pregnancy & Mental Health
While the majority of women cope well with the changes associated with pregnancy and motherhood, some experience
distress that can potentially affect the health of both mother
and child. Major depression and some anxiety disorders are
common in the general population and may also be seen in
pregnant women.
Other issues that may occur as a result of maternal mental
disorders during pregnancy include poor sleep, poor eating
and inadequate weight gain, increase in stress hormone potentially (causing high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, & early/
complicated delivery for the mother and impaired growth for
the developing baby), poor motivation to seek prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal care, and alcohol and other substance
abuse (e.g. cigarettes, illicit drug).
Although conditions such as depression and anxiety may be
treated with medication, drugs are used with significant caution during pregnancy. There have been studies with some
antidepressant agents that indicate efficacy but these studies
are very limited and still advise caution due to the potential
risk to the fetus.
Helping the mother make lifestyle adjustments and utilize the
support of family, friends, and educational resources is highly
emphasized. Prevention is important - a healthcare provider
who is able to identify depressive or anxiety symptoms early
and provide support can reduce a mother’s potential for developing a depressive or anxiety disorder.
III: Conditions & Issues: Maternal Mental Health
99
Post - Partum Conditions
The mother may experience distress following the delivery of the child. Conditions after birth may include post
-partum sadness (also known as post-partum “blues”),
post-partum depression, or post-partum psychosis. Specific symptoms and management of these conditions are
outlined in the table on the following page.
Maternal mental disorders may have a significant effect
not only on the mother but also on the infant and other
family members. For example, depression and anxiety in
the mother may lead to poor mother-infant attachment,
affecting the child’s social, emotional, and cognitive
development. In addition, marital problems including
disruption of marriage and abuse by the partner may
occur as a result of mental illness in a mother after childbirth.

Condition Symptoms Management
Post-partum
Sadness or
“Blues”
Common; Mildly depressed mood, irritability,
anxiety, insomnia, tearfulness (often 1-10 days after
delivery)
Symptoms remit spontaneously
but educate mother and family
that this occurrence is common;
however, symptoms persisting
beyond 2 weeks should be evaluated (for the possibility of a
depressive disorder).
Post-partum
Depression
Sadness; anger; insomnia;
fatigue; impaired sleep;
impaired appetite; decreased sexual interest;
crying spells without
obvious cause; worthlessness; hopelessness; poor
memory and concentration.


Creating a supportive environment for the mother; encouraging
self-care.
Counseling and education about
symptoms; monitor for suicidal
thoughts; antidepressant medication if symptoms are severe and
persistent (take caution with
mothers who are breast-feeding).
See section on “Mood Disorders -
Depression” for treatment.
Post-partum
Psychosis
Uncommon; disorganized
thought; delusions that the
child may be defective or
dying, or that he or she is
not her real child. She may
also have ideas of killing
her child to protect him
against illogical threats.


Education about symptoms;
monitor for homicidal thoughts;
anti-psychotic medication only
for severe, persistent psychotic
symptoms (take caution with
mothers who are breast-feeding).

MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN CHILDREN
1. Neurodevelopmental Disorders
The neurodevelopmental disorders are conditions that tend to occur early in the developmental period and may include impairments in intelligence, executive function, learning, and social
skills. Personal, social, academic, and occupational functioning
may be limited with some disorders manifesting with deficits and
delays in reaching normal developmental milestones. Symptoms
often occur prior to a child’s entering grade school and often occur co-morbidly with other neurodevelopmental disorders.
The Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth
Edition (DSM-V) classifies neurodevelopmental disorders into
categories including intellectual disabilities, communication disorders, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific learning disorder, motor
disorders, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In this chapter,
specific conditions that are emphasized include intellectual developmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and
Tourette’s disorder (motor disorder).
A) Intellectual Disability (intellectual developmental disorder)
Intellectual disability, or intellectual developmental disorder, is a
condition of disabled mental abilities, such as reasoning, problem
solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning,
and learning from experience. An individual’s adaptive functioning in daily life may be impaired such that he or she is unable to
become an independent and responsible member of society.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
102
The global prevalence of intellectual disability is about two out of
every hundred persons. Prenatal causes of intellectual disability
include genetic syndromes, inborn errors of metabolism, brain
malformations, maternal disease, and environmental influences.
Perinatal and postnatal causes have included complications during
labor and delivery, oxygen deprivation, traumatic brain injury,
infections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders, severe and
chronic social deprivation, and toxic metabolic syndromes and
intoxications. A diagnosis of intellectual disability requires that an
individual has impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning relative to the individual’s age, gender, and socio-culturally matched
peers. The onset of these deficits is during the developmental period before adulthood. Treatments for intellectual disability include
early behavioral intervention, special education, specialized services, adaptive skill training, and transition planning.
B) Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism spectrum disorder is a condition of impaired social communication and social interaction and the presence of restricted,
repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. Across US
and non-US countries, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder
is approximately 1% of the population. Many factors may place a
child at risk for autism spectrum disorder, such as advanced parental age, low birth weight, premature birth, or fetal exposure to valproic acid. Twin concordance studies have indicated heritability
estimates ranging from 37% to 90% . Various genetic mutations
have also been suggested as a contributing factor in some cases. A
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is considered with the occurrence of continual deficits in reciprocal social communication
and interaction and patterns of behavior, interests, or activities that
are significantly restricted or repetitive. Symptoms begin during
early childhood and hinder daily functioning. Effective treatments
for autism spectrum disorder are early intervention services including applied behavioral analysis.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
103
Dealing with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder:
general points
Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder are chronic
conditions. It is possible to help both the child and family make
adaptations in their environment and interactions that will facilitate
stable functioning. It is important to make a thorough evaluation
of the child’s psychiatric history (especially the developmental
history) and perform a mental status examination. Be sure to ask
about relatives who have had a similar condition.
Educate the family about the fact that the child has both limitations
and potential. If available, seek evaluation by a specialist who can
provide additional input on the specific diagnosis, degree of limitations, and the appropriate interventions. The important tasks will
be accepting what the child cannot do and encouraging the development of skills the child possesses and can further develop.
Because comorbidity may occur with other neurodevelopmental,
mental, and medical conditions (e.g. intellectual disability can be
associated with conditions such as hyperactivity, depression, and
epilepsy) inquire about these problems and provide or refer them
to the appropriate treatment.
The family should provide structure by organizing a routine schedule for the child to follow that is appropriate to the child’s level of
function. This routine will help the child know what to expect and
what to do – this can minimize anxiety and distress. The schedule
should include a list of core activities of daily living that are appropriate to level of function so that basic self-care skills are fostered
and maintained (e.g. washing; dressing; keeping the room tidy;
food preparation, going to the market).
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
104
Include chores appropriate to the level of function so that a sense
of responsibility is maintained. Whenever possible, have the child
be actively involved in deciding work and pleasure activities. Be
sure there is a good balance between indoor and outdoor activities.
Also be sure to incorporate activities that involve social interaction.
Fostering “protective” factors can prevent the deterioration of a
child’s condition and help children to achieve their goals. Important protective factors include good physical health, healthy parentchild attachment, and a cohesive family unit within a supportive
social network.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
105
C) Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
ADHD may be defined as a persistent pattern of inattention and/or
hyperactivity-impulsivity that causes significant impairment in
social or academic (occupational for adults) function (or marked
distress) and is more frequent and severe than is typically observed
in individuals at a comparable level of development.
ADHD occurs in approximately 5% of children and 2.5% of adults
in most cultures, according to population surveys. Sources have
indicated that low birth weight, premature delivery, smoking and
alcohol use during pregnancy, exposure to environment toxicants,
and brain injury are factors that have been variably correlated with
ADHD, but are not known to be causal. ADHD heritability rates
are rather high and specific genes have been correlated with the
disorder.
Signs/Characteristics
Symptoms may exist as inattention singly or as hyperactivity/
impulsivity, or a combination of inattention + hyperactivity/
impulsivity. Symptoms of ADHD usually become apparent in
primary school or other environments that are structured settings
demanding task completion. In the school setting, teachers’ observations are important. Teachers are in a position to compare patterns of compliance, on-task behavior, capacity for fundamental
learning tasks (e.g. reading, spelling, arithmetic) and disruptiveness with other children pursuing similar tasks. A diagnosis of
ADHD requires a continuous pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that negatively affects an individual’s functioning or development.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
106
Specific symptoms related to inattention may include:
 Poor attention to detail in work, school, and activities.
 Not attentive when spoken to.
 Easily distracted by external stimuli.
 Forgetfulness.
 Inconsistent follow through or execution of tasks and activities.
 Tendency to lose items associated with tasks or activities to
be completed.
 Problem organizing activities or tasks.
 Tendency to dislike activities that require the capacity to be
attentive.
 Impaired school performance and fundamental learning
skills (e.g. reading, spelling, arithmetic) as a result of poor
attention capacity
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
107
Specific symptoms related to hyperactivity and impulsivity
include:
 Inability to sit quietly or be at rest when appropriate to do
so.
 Excessive physical activity (e.g. climbing, running, jumping) when not appropriate.
 Speaking excessively.
 Tendency to interrupt or intrude on others’ activities.
 Tendency to speak or act out of turn .
Reminder:
Not every child with problems at school or increased energy or
activity level is considered to have ADHD. It is considered a problem ONLY if there is continuing interruption in school achievement or appropriate social interaction.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
108
Management of ADHD
Avoid physical punishment as it aggravates the problem -
rewarding the child for good behavior is more effective. Never
give the child two tasks at the same time (i.e. give him or her one
play activity or one toy at a time).
Educate the family that the child has a problem, needs help, and
that patience is necessary. However, help the family also understand that they should not shy away from setting limits and should
not be manipulated by the child. Teach the family interventions
such as how to structure the child’s day and organize his or her
activities. Stimulant medications (e.g. methylphenidate) should be
considered only if the problem persists and interferes with function
and the child has shown no response to behavioral interventions.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
109
Management – Structuring the Child’s Day
Children with ADHD may need help in organizing, therefore:
 Schedule. Have the same routine every day, from wakeup time to bedtime. The schedule should include homework time and playtime (including outdoor recreation and
indoor activities). If a schedule change must be made,
make it as far in advance as possible.
 Organize needed everyday items. Have a place for everything and keep everything in its place. This includes
clothing, backpacks, and school supplies.
 Use homework and notebook organizers. Stress the importance of writing down assignments and bringing home
needed books.
 Children with ADHD need consistent rules. Set consistent rules that they can understand and follow. If rules are
followed, give a token of praise. Children with ADHD
often receive, and expect criticism. Look for good behavior and praise it.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
110
D) Tourette’s Disorder
Tourette’s disorder is a condition of multiple motor and vocal tics
that occur for at least 1 year in variable frequencies. Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or vocalizations. The global prevalence of Tourette’s disorder ranges from 1
to 30 per 1,000 persons according to studies. Research suggests
Tourette’s disorder is an inherited disorder, for which specific
genes have been identified. Risk factors may include birth complications, older paternal age, lower birth weight, and maternal smoking or alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
A diagnosis of Tourette’s disorder requires the presence of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics that occur for at least 1
year, and begin before age 18 years. Also, the tics cannot be due
to substance use or another medical condition. Medication and
behavioral therapy help to treat tics that cause physical injury or
pain, or that interfere with daily functioning. However, some individuals have tics that do not interfere with their daily functioning
and do not need treatment.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
111
2. Emotional and Behavioral Problems
A) Depression and anxiety
Depression and some anxiety disorders are common in the adult population but occur with notable frequency in children as well. Depression and anxiety may coexist and, as with other conditions, may be
expressed differently from one individual to the next. These conditions may be expressed in behavior or other nonverbal expressions,
since children are at an early stage in their emotional maturity. A
depressed child may appear sad, angry or agitated and may isolate
from others. Children with anxiety, depression or a combination of
both may also experience sleep problems or exhibit poor performance
in school.
Management of depression or anxiety in children involves providing
support for the child and education for the family. Antidepressant
medications are not recommended for children (some medicines have
been shown to increase distress and ideas of suicide) and many shortterm anti-anxiety medicines have potential for addiction. Help the
child and family identify the actions that may represent the distress
and help them to identify the circumstances in which these actions
occur. Even though a child’s emotions are developing he or she can
still be taught basic ways to verbalize distress. Using simple culturally appropriate picture charts showing different emotions and situations with which the child can identify, can be a way to begin discussions about feelings. Encourage the verbalization of distress. Verbalization can improve another’s (family, schoolmates, teachers) ability to understand the child’s problem and provide a more effective
response. Help the child recognize and understand that negative feelings such as anger and disappointment are natural human emotions
and that there are constructive ways to manage these emotions (i.e.
help the child to identify and anticipate difficult situations and teach
the child a variety of healthy responses to the situations).
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
112
It is equally important to help caretakers with distress obtain support, as children’s emotions can often reflect the emotional climate
within their environment. For example, a depressed parent may
not have the energy or motivation to attend to the child’s basic
emotional needs. This can turn into psychological distress and
emotional problems for the child.
B) Elimination Disorders
Enuresis (bed-wetting)
Enuresis may be defined as the inability of the child to control his
bladder (after 5 years of age). The condition is not related to a
secondary cause (such as a medical problem or ingestion of diuretic agents) but is psychological in nature. Enuresis may occur
during sleep or while awake. Enuresis causes a lot of stress and
shame for the child and can lead to more serious problem if not
treated early. A thorough psychiatric history, mental status examination with emphasis on the developmental history, medical history, and social environment is important.
Management of Enuresis
A medical evaluation should be done to eliminate underlying
medical causes for the problem. Be sure to assess for environmental conditions (e.g. if the wetting occurs during school time, is
it due to dirty toilets, or unavailable toilets at school?). Also assess
for other underlying psychological distress (e.g. the child who wets
the bed may experience nightmares or night terrors and may be too
afraid to go to the toilet).
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
113
Helpful Techniques
 Avoid bedtime fluid intake.
 The child should avoid an excess of foods or
drinks that can stimulate urination (diuretics).
 The child should be taught to empty the bladder
before going to sleep. Exercises to strengthen the
bladder musculature may be used as well (e.g.
start urination for 2-3 seconds, then stop the urination and hold for 5 seconds. Then resume and
complete urination. Practicing this action each
time the child must urinate can help to strengthen
the muscles that control urine outflow).
 If the child is old enough, involve him/her in
washing the bed sheets or clothes to decrease
guilt and increase a sense of control and worth
(sometimes the child has guilt believing that he/
she causes inconvenience or distress for others).
 Another intervention that encourages selfesteem, self-control and self- worth is a calendar
or chart that indicates progress in the child’s
decreased bed-wetting behavior. Instructions for
creating the chart are outlined on the next page.
III: Conditions & Issues: Mental Health Issues in Children
114
Monitoring Bed-wetting – the progress chart/calendar
 Make an attractive chart for the child that includes the
days of the week (or use a calendar).
 Make the design simple since it is the child who will be
actively filling in the chart.
 Have the child mark √ for the dry days and X for wet days
(try to use the expressions “wet and dry” to minimize the
stigma of the problem).
 To make it more fun, you can also have the child color the
dry days with green and the wet days with red (or draw a
sun for dry and clouds for wet etc…).
 At the end of each week ask the child to count dry and
wet days and give him a reward for each improvement
(e.g. if he had 5 wet days on the first week and 4 on second then offer a token of praise. If he maintains this improvement for 2 weeks continue to reward him; with additional improvement offer additional rewards).
 If after one month you are not getting benefits, reconsider
underlying causes and another medical work-up.

C) Conduct Disorder
Conduct disorder may be defined as a persistent or repetitive pattern of behavior that involves aggression toward people or animals,
destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, and serious violations of well-established rules or social norms. Conduct disorder
in children has been associated with infant temperament, lowerthan-average intelligence, and instability in the family. In addition, violent behaviors have been correlated with physical or sexual abuse and alcoholism or drug use within the family.
An assessment not only of the child but also of the family and
other environmental influences will elucidate information that will
guide treatment. Education on how to identify and express emotions may be useful to the child and families. Alcohol and drug
treatment should be recommended to those in need. Threats to a
child’s safety should be reported to the appropriate authorities.
III: Conditions & Issues: Adolescent Psychosocial Issues
117
ADOLESCENT PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES
Neuropsychiatric disorders are a leading cause of health-related
burden for youth, accounting for 15–30% of the disability-adjusted
life-years (DALYs) lost during the first three decades of life. With
regard to the global perspective (particularly regarding low and
middle-income countries), important psychosocial issues in adolescents have included substance abuse, violent behavior, and unsafe
sexual behavior.
Substance Abuse
Risk factors associated with adolescent substance abuse include:
 Male gender
 Youth
 Genetics
 Mental health
 Poor personal/social skills
 Family dysfunction
 Dysfunctional peer group
 Limited educational or occupational opportunities
Peer pressure, excitement/enjoyment, self image, risk taking/
rebellion, curiosity, and experimentation are reasons cited by youth
to use substances.
III: Conditions & Issues: Adolescent Psychosocial Issues
118
Factors that may be protective include a supportive family, individual
motivation, high self esteem, and low motivation for impulsivity. In addition, having educational or occupational opportunities and an interest
and capacity for socialization may reduce the risk for engaging in substance abuse.
Intervention:
 Evaluate mental and medical status
 Stabilize acute psychiatric and medical conditions
 Assess for underlying chronic psychiatric conditions; assess current
social situation
 Provide information – regarding effects of drug
 Provide support – offer encouragement and referral to supportive
services
Violence & Adolescents
From a global perspective, studies have indicated that violent death is not
uncommon among adolescents and young adults. Among youth 10-29
years of age worldwide, each year approximately 250 000 homicides
occur, constituting 41% of the annual total number of homicides globally.
Social, political, and economic upheaval may be strong predictors of
youth conflict (as opposed to poverty alone). In addition, adolescent girls
(age 12-17) may be at particular risk for being sexually violated.
III: Conditions & Issues: Adolescent Psychosocial Issues

 Neighborhood deprivation
 4) Societal Factors
 Culture of violence
 Social & economic inequality
III: Conditions & Issues: Adolescent Psychosocial Issues
120
Managing Adolescent Violence
Dealing with youth violence involves continued research that will
help guide effective interventions. Development and government
agencies will need to play a role in establishing policies which
serve to change cultural and social norms that support violence.
Raising awareness of the health consequences of youth violence
and the importance of prevention is an important focus. Youth
violence prevention policies and programs should be created. Specific preventive measures may include developing life skills in
children and adolescents, decreasing the availability and harmful
use of alcohol, and decreasing access to lethal means (e.g. guns,
knives, pesticides).
Victims/Survivors of Violence
Youth are especially vulnerable regarding violence given their
level of dependence, limited capacity to protect themselves, and
limited power and participation in decision-making processes.
Health care providers, relief workers and protection officers should
devote special attention to their psychosocial needs.
Interventions for victims/survivors of violence:
 Protection
 Medical support as indicated
 Psychosocial support
 Monitoring by health facilities
 Education (i.e. individuals, families, communities)
III: Conditions & Issues: Adolescent Psychosocial Issues
121
Unsafe Sexual Behavior
Studies suggest evidence of high risk behavior among youth (e.g.
being sexually active at a young age and irregular use of condoms). Factors that promote or perpetrate unsafe sexual behavior
have included: personal factors; proximal environment; distal or
broader social context; and interaction among factors.
1) Personal factors:
 Knowledge & beliefs
 Perception of low personal risk
 Self expectations
 Perceived costs & benefits
 Intentions
 Self-esteem

 Uncontrolled psychiatric condition such as mania, bipolar
disorder, or psychosis.
 Untreated medical condition affecting the brain as an infection, tumor, or metabolic disease.
 Medication toxicity caused by an excessive amount or variety
of medicines ingested.
 Alcohol or drug intoxication and withdrawal.
Intervention for Agitation/Aggression
 Alert and elicit the help of other healthcare staff or authorities.
 Take distance and help others remain a safe distance from the
agitated person.
 Safety – if possible, try to remove from the environment items
that are potentially hazardous to safety. Remain calm and confident.
 Listen, pay attention, do not argue.
 If possible (without subjecting yourself to harm) try to talk
down or deescalate the individual by using a soft speech tone,
expressing support and reassurance, and minimizing physical
gestures.

2) SUICIDE
Risk Factors (western studies)
 Age (15-24yrs; elderly)
 Male gender
 Intense, prolonged suicidal thinking
 Past suicidal behavior
General questions to ask about suicide:
Do you feel very sad?
Do you feel that no one cares about you?
Do you feel you cannot go on?
Do you feel that life is not worth living?
Do you sometimes wish you were dead?
Have you thought of ending your life?
Are you having such thoughts now?
How often?
Have you actually made any plan?
III: Conditions & Issues: Crisis Situations
127
Intervention for High risk Suicide (The person has a definite plan & the means to do it immediately).
 Stay with the person. Never leave the person
alone.
 Gently talk to the person and remove the pills,
knife, gun, insecticide, etc. (distance the means of
suicide).
 Contact a mental health professional immediately,
if available; Contact the local emergency services
(or police) if mental health professionals are not
available; Arrange for an ambulance and hospitalization.
 Contact the family or others significant to the
individual and enlist their support.
 If a professional is not available for ongoing support, arrange future meetings at regular intervals
and maintain ongoing contact.

3) DISASTER/EMERGENCY SETTINGS
A. General
Disasters or emergencies may be defined from different perspectives and have been characterized based on their potential
for causing:

 Overwhelming physical environmental damage.
 Significant human morbidity or mortality.
 Impaired psychosocial function of individuals and communities.
 Impaired economic capacity of individuals or communities.
 Mobilization of revenue by organizations or government
agencies to provide relief.
A disaster/emergency may be defined as a significant naturerelated (e.g. earthquakes, tsunami, hurricanes, floods, etc) or
human-related event (e.g. armed conflict)) that directly threatens life or compromises the basic needs required to sustain life
(i.e. food, shelter, water & sanitation, security, disease control,
or access to health care).
Disaster/emergency relief is defined in this text as the relief
or assistance provided by various organizations or agencies in
response to a nature-related or human-related emergency.
III: Conditions & Issues: Crisis Situations
129
B. Phases of disaster/emergency relief & mental health interventions
A disaster or emergency relief effort may be described in
terms of phases that include an acute emergency phase and
post-emergency or reconsolidation phase. An affected
population may experience varied degrees or fluctuate between phases depending on regional circumstances. The acute
emergency phase has been defined as the period where crude
mortality rate is increased due to circumstances or an environment in which basic needs (i.e. food, shelter, security, water/
sanitation, disease control, and access to health care) are diminished.
During the emergency phase the focus is primarily on social
interventions such as restoration of basic needs (i.e. food, shelter, security, water/sanitation, disease control, and access to
health care). Psychological and psychiatric interventions during this phase are aimed at acute situations: the relief of acute
distress through psychological first aid (see the next page);
evaluation and treatment of severe conditions including suicidal intentions, psychosis, mania, severe depression, and epilepsy; and ensuring the availability of psychotropic medications for patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions.

Elements of Psychological First Aid (Sources: IASC Task Force on Mental Health & Psychosocial Support, 2007)
Elements Of Psychological First Aid
 Allowing survivors to discuss the events if they desire, without pressure;
respect one’s wish not to talk.
 Listening.
 Conveying compassion.
 Assessing and addressing basic needs (i.e. shelter, food, protection,
health care, etc…).
 Discuss ways to manage or cope with stress (discourage destructive actions such as alcohol or substance abuse; encourage culturally appropriate
constructive normal daily activities).
 Encouraging but not forcing company from significant others.
 If available, refer to local support mechanisms/mental health clinicians
particularly if distress has been severe and sustained.
 Minimize the use of anti-anxiety medicines such as benzodiazepines
which can be addictive (e.g. diazepam or alprazolam). If anxiety is severe and sustained (such that ability to function or manage self care is
impaired) short-term use of an anti-anxiety medicine on an as needed
basis can be used (i.e. start by giving a three day supply and instruct the
individual to only use medicine in moments of overwhelming distress).
Refer individuals with severe or sustained distress for further psychiatric
evaluation and treatment if resources are available. Do not institute
therapies or medications that require long-term or ongoing monitoring if
no mechanism for monitoring (i.e. facilities or mental health staff trained
to follow up) is established and available.
III: Conditions & Issues: Crisis Situations
131
The post-emergency or reconsolidation phase has been
defined as the period when basic needs have been restored
to pre-emergency levels or to a standard within the population that represents a stable health condition. Emergency
phase social, psychological, and psychiatric interventions
are continued as needed during this phase. Postemergency social interventions are focused on outreach
and education while psychological and psychiatric evaluation and treatment services are further integrated into the
existing primary health care structure.

GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE
IN INSECURE SETTINGS
Overview
In this discussion, an insecure setting is comparable to an emergency/ disaster relief (or humanitarian emergency) setting which
may include communities uprooted or displaced by war, communities affected by natural disasters, or communities that have lost
their integrity or structure due to other destabilizing circumstances.
Gender-based violence (GBV) has been associated with insecure
settings. Because of the serious nature and impact of GBV, the
subject is addressed exclusively in this chapter.
The data on the prevalence and incidence of GBV in insecure settings have limitations due to under-reporting of incidents. Underreporting occurs for many reasons including fear of retaliation and
re-victimization, stigma, self blame, and mistrust of authorities.
Data available on GBV have indicated, a female victim and male
perpetrator are involved most frequently. While men and boys may
also be vulnerable to sexual violence (particularly in situations of
torture and detention ) the majority of survivors/victims of sexual
violence have been females.
Because there is a tendency for under-reporting, it is important that
healthcare staff working in unstable environments have an awareness and willingness to take constructive action when violence is
suspected. This chapter provides an outline of information on the
nature, causes, effects, and active interventions associated with
gender-based violence in insecure settings.
III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
134
Definitions & Causes of Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
Gender– based violence (GBV) has been defined broadly as any
harmful act that is imposed against an individual’s will, and that is
based on socially ascribed (gender) differences between males and
females. Specific types of GBV may vary across countries, regions, and cultures and may include: a) domestic violence; b)
forced/early marriage; c) harmful traditional practices (e.g. female
genital mutilation, honor killings, widow inheritance); d) trafficking; and e) sexual violence.
Regarding sexual violence, it may be described as an unwanted,
destructive sexual advance that is executed (e.g. as a sexual action)
or implied (e.g. as sexual verbal expression). Studies have indicated that power and control underlie the perpetration as opposed
to an amorous attraction or desire. Forms of sexual violence seen
in insecure settings have included: rape (most often cited); attempted assaults; verbal sexual threats and humiliating comments;
molestation or repeated unwanted advances; domestic violence
toward a spouse; and incest toward a family relative.
Reports have indicated that groups associated with GBV perpetration in insecure settings may include fellow refugees; other clan
members; religious or ethnic groups; military personnel; relief
workers; and family members. Regarding sexual violence, the
survivor often knows the perpetrator.
III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
135
Potential factors contributing to gender-based violence (GBV) in
insecure settings
A) Displacement and the loss of community structures (due to social and armed conflict; natural
disaster; or poverty and limited social and economic resources). Women and children may
become separated from family and community
supports, rendering them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
B) In conflict situations, women and children may
be targeted particularly and GBV may be used as
a tool for interrogation. Power and domination
are employed with an intent to intimidate, humiliate, and control or hurt others. Abduction
and sexual slavery occur in this setting.
C) Local populations may perceive refugees who
receive special aid as privileged and therefore
attack.
D) Male disrespect toward women leading to inequity in providing women food, shelter, security,
and other necessities.
E) As a means for survival, women may be in the
vulnerable position of bartering sex for food,
shelter, and other necessities putting them at risk
for abuse and violence.
III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
136
Effects of GBV
The effects of GBV may manifest as medical, psychological, social, and economic problems:
A) Medical: sexually transmitted disease (e.g. syphilis, HIV);
damage to the reproductive tract and susceptibility to
chronic infections leading to pelvic inflammatory disease;
unwanted pregnancy; unsafe abortion; and death from
injuries.
B) Psychological: depression; terror; guilt; shame; loss of selfesteem; and suicide.
C) Social: rejection by a spouse, family, and community; loss
of relationship with children.
D) Economic: loss of home, property, and security provided
by family.
III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
137
Active Interventions for GBV Incidents
In an insecure setting, efforts should be made, if possible, to identify and help coordinate local resources for protection, medical
care, and psychosocial care.
1) Protection:
A) Maintain confidentiality.
B) Give individuals privacy, do not force them to
express more than they desire, and reassure that
they are in a safe setting while with you.
C) Allow the individual to have family or friends be
present if desired; if the incident has been recent,
be aware that a medical evaluation may be required.
D) Contact the police if the individual is amenable.
2) Medical Care – refer and provide an escort to medical care
as indicated.
 In cases of sexual assault/rape it is important to be aware
of local and national laws (where they exist) and the procedures to collect forensic evidence as indicated. Procedures often indicate that the survivor should not wash,
urinate, defecate, or change clothes before the medical
exam in order to preserve important evidence.
III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
138
A complete history of the incident and a physical examination
should be conducted. As indicted, the history should include the
nature of sexual contact, menstrual history, and mental state. The
physical exam should note the condition of clothing, presence of
foreign materials, evidence of physical trauma, and, as indicated,
involve the collection of materials such as hair particles, fingernail
scrapings, sperm, saliva, and blood samples.
Tests and treatments as indicated (e.g. tests for pregnancy, HIV,
and syphilis; appropriate treatments for medical issues) should be
provided. In addition, comprehensive counseling and follow-up
medical care should be offered.
3) Psychosocial care

Reactions to GBV
Common reactions to GBV include fear, guilt, shame and anger.
Survivors may adopt strong defense mechanisms that include forgetting, denial and deep repression of the events. Reactions vary
from minor depression, grief, anxiety, phobia, and somatic problems to serious and chronic mental conditions. Extreme reactions
to sexual violence may result in suicide or, in the case of pregnancy, physical abandonment or elimination of the child.
III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
139
Supportive Counseling
Objectives of supportive counseling include helping survivors to
understand what they have experienced, to express and place in
perspective negative emotions, and to access support networks and
services. Specific counseling points may include:
 Asking questions in a non-judgmental, nonintrusive, relevant manner; also, be aware that
details and the sequence of information may
change as the emotional state changes.
 If self-blame emerges, reassure the survivor that
the perpetrator is to blame.
 Assess needs or concerns for safety and help the
survivor develop a realistic safety plan.
 Always provide accurate information about services and facilities.
 Empower the survivor; always allow individuals
to make their own choices and decisions.
 Encourage re-engagement in a daily routine and
in activities with family and supports within the
community.
 Discourage comfort in alcohol or other substance
abuse.

III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
140

Community-Level Support
Community-based activities have been shown to be effective in
helping to decrease trauma for GBV survivors. Supportive interventions on the community level include: a) identifying and training traditional, community-based support workers; b) developing
women's support groups or support groups specifically designed
for survivors of sexual violence and their families; and c) creating
special drop-in centers for survivors where they can receive confidential and compassionate attention.
Children & Adolescents
Children and youth are especially vulnerable to GBV given their
level of dependence, limited capacity to protect themselves, and
limited power and participation in decision-making processes.
Health personnel assisting children should have the appropriate
level of training and skills. Age appropriate language and creative
communication methods should be used (e.g. drawing, games,
story-telling). Never coerce or restrain abused children and include
trusted family members in the treatment process. Children should
not be removed from family care for treatment unless there is
abuse or neglect and protection is required.
Regarding adolescents, females may be specifically targeted for
sexual violence in situations of armed conflict and severe economic hardship. Health care providers, relief workers and protection officers should devote special attention to their psychosocial
needs.
III: Conditions & Issues: Gender-Based Violence
141
Other Issues
GBV & Domestic Violence
Be cautious in situations where violence has occurred by a spouse
or other family member (domestic violence). The survivor and/ or
other relatives may be susceptible to further danger and retaliation,
especially if the abuser is aware that the incident has been reported. Assess each case on an individual basis, utilizing the support of other colleagues in deciding an appropriate response.
Health care providers may choose to refer the matter to a disciplinary committee, inform the authorities, or provide discreet advice
to the survivor about the potential options.
Children of Rape
Children born as a result of rape are susceptible to stigma, abuse
and even abandonment. Therefore, these children must be monitored closely. Families and mothers particularly should be offered
education and support. Foster placement and, later, adoption
should be considered if the child is rejected, neglected or abused in
other ways.

HIV/AIDS & MENTAL HEALTH
HIV/AIDS Global Summary
Worldwide, an estimated 34 million people were living with HIV at the end
of 2010. In 2010, there were 2.7 million new HIV infections. Most newly
infected people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and the annual number of newly
infected individuals continues to decline. In 2010, an estimated 1.9 million
people became infected representing a 16% decrease from the estimated 2.2
million newly infected in 2001. However in regions including the Middle
east and North Africa, the annual number of people newly infected with HIV
has increased to 59,000 in 2010 compared to 43,000 in 2001. In addition,
since 2008, the incidence of HIV infection has grown in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia.
Globally, the annual number of people dying from AIDS-related causes continues to decline with an estimated 1.8 million in 2010 compared to 2.2 million in 2005. The number of people dying annually from AIDS-related
causes began to decline in 2005 and continues to decrease in sub-Saharan
Africa, the Caribbean, and South and Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, AIDSrelated deaths have increased dramatically in Central Asia, East Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa
The availability of antiretroviral therapy in low– and middle-income countries worldwide (particularly countries in Sub-Saharan Africa) has been responsible for preventing 2.5 million deaths since 1995. Since 1995, more
than 350,000 children (86% from Sub-Saharan Africa), have been spared
from contracting HIV due to antiretroviral prophylaxis being available to
pregnant women living with the virus.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
144
New evidence-based studies have indicated also that people living with the
HIV are less likely to transmit the virus and that individuals who are HIVnegative and have taken antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis orally as a
tablet or vaginally in gel form have reduced their risk of contracting the
virus.
HIV/AIDS & Mental Health –General Overview
HIV disease has the capacity to affect the physical, psychological, and social well-being of individuals. A number of the medical diseases associated
with HIV manifest as neurological or neuropsychiaric illnesses (e.g. neuropathy, central nervous system infections and tumors). People infected by
the virus may be burdened also by emotions such as fear, anger, and guilt,
which, if not placed in perspective, may contribute to more severe psychiatric conditions. In addition, social consequences of HIV disease have included stigma, loss of household income and financial stability, and the
destruction of family and community structures.
Mental health support in general (e.g. psychoeducation; supportive group,
family, and individual counseling; and, in the case of severe illness, medication therapy) may play a role in influencing the overall health of individuals whose lives have been affected by the epidemic. Special forms of
counseling, such as HIV information/prevention counseling and adherence
counseling, are associated with mental health and are important to decreasing the spread of infection and the proliferation of disease.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
145
Medical Aspects of HIV/AIDS
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a type of virus (specifically a
retrovirus) that can invade and destroy cells of the immune system. HIV
can cause AIDS (or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) which is a
collection of symptoms or medical conditions that indicate immune dysfunction.
HIV can enter the body through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast
milk. HIV is most often transmitted through sexual contact or the transfer
of contaminated blood (through blood transfusions or intravenous drug
abuse). Infants can be infected in the uterus or through breast-feeding
when their mothers are infected with HIV.
Data from several countries indicates that the acquisition and transmission
of HIV is reduced with abstinence from sexual activity, condom use, decreased sharing of contaminated drug paraphernalia, screened blood products used for transfusions, and the use of antiretroviral medication . Education and HIV testing are the means by which individuals can understand
and take action to prevent or manage disease.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
146
Measures of Immunity & HIV Infection: CD4+ Immune Cells & Viral
Load
CD4+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ T cells) are cells of the immune system that
play a role in protecting the body from certain infections. HIV targets
CD4+ T cells, disables their normal function, and facilitates a genetic
process that leads to proliferation of the virus. CD4+ T cells can be measured through analysis of a blood sample. The US National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has cited a normal CD4+ T cell
count as 800-1200mm3 (other sources have cited a normal range = 500-
1500mm3). A low CD4+ T cell count is an indication of impairment of an
aspect of the immune system and raises suspicion for HIV disease. Experts
have indicated that counts of less than 500mm3 usually mean damage to
the immune system, counts less than 200mm3 mean severe damage, and
counts less than 50mm3 mean damage of even greater severity. When
antiretroviral medications are used CD4+ T cell counts improve.
The viral “load” is a measure of the amount of viral particles in a given
blood sample and may be an indication of one’s response to treatment and
prognosis. The viral load found in blood has been found to accurately
reflect the total burden of HIV in the body.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
147
Phases of HIV Infection
HIV should be viewed as a spectrum of disorders ranging from acute
(primary) infection with or without an acute retroviral syndrome, to the asymptomatic state, to advanced disease.
A) Acute Primary Infection
Once HIV enters the body, the virus infects a large number of CD4+ T cells
and rapidly multiplies, significantly increasing the viral load. Studies have
indicated that following primary infection, as many as 50-70% of infected
individuals may develop an acute “flu-like” syndrome, also known as acute
retroviral syndrome (ARS). This has been estimated to occur 3-6 weeks after
infection and may last from 1-4 weeks. Symptoms of ARS may include fever,
sweats, fatigue, joint pain, headache, sore throat and enlarged lymph nodes or
glands. Some individuals may also experience a skin rash and neuropsychiatric symptoms such confusion, mood changes, and personality changes. As the
immune system mounts a response, the viral load declines and the CD4+ T
cell count rises and reconstitutes. As the immune response progresses, symptoms of ARS decrease. Most individuals will then enter a period of clinical
latency where the virus is less active.
B) Clinical Latency
During this phase, the virus is still present in the body, but is less active.
Many individuals do not have any symptoms of HIV infection. The duration
of this period can vary greatly among individuals, but the median has been
estimated to be 10 years.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
148
C) Advanced Disease - Progression to AIDS
While symptoms of HIV disease may develop during any phase of infection,
the extent of illness is generally increased as the CD4+ T cell count declines.
More severe complications of infection have been associated with CD4+ T
cell counts < 200mm3. AIDS is diagnosed when an HIV-infected individual
has one or more opportunistic infections (discussed in the following sections) and has a CD4+ T cell count < 200mm3 (or CD4 percentage <14%
according to the US Center for Disease Control classification).
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a clinical staging
system (outlined below) for resource-constrained settings where extensive
laboratory testing may not be readily available. In this system, AIDS is diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms observed upon examination.
WHO HIV/AIDS Clinical Staging System (for Adults & Adolescents)

A. Primary HIV Infection: asymptomatic; Acute retroviral syndrome (ARS).
B. Clinical Stage 1: asymptomatic, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy
(in at least two sites, not including inguinal, for longer than 6 months); this
stage may last for several years.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
149
C. Clinical Stage 2 (mild symptomatic stage): moderate weight loss (< 10%
of total body weight); recurrent respiratory infections (e.g. bronchitis, otitis
media, and pharyngitis, sinusitis); skin conditions (e.g. angular cheilitis,
fungal nail infections, herpes zoster, papular pruritic eruptions, recurrent oral
ulcerations, and seborrheic dermatitis).
D. Clinical Stage 3 (moderate symptomatic stage): severe weight loss ( >10
% of total body weight); unexplained diarrhea > 1 month; pulmonary tuberculosis; severe bacterial infections including pneumonia, pyelonephritis,
empyema, pyomyositis, meningitis, bone and joint infections, and bacteremia; other conditions including recurrent oral candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, and acute necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis, gingivitis, or periodontitis.
E. Clinical Stage 4 (severe symptomatic stage): HIV wasting syndrome, HIV encephalopathy, and varied conditions associated with opportunistic infections and tumors related to HIV/AIDS (see next section).
Opportunistic Infections (OIs)
The term opportunistic indicates an infection that takes the “opportunity” to
flourish when there is compromised function of the immune system. OIs
include Toxoplama encephalitis, cryptococcus, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia (PCP), Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, herpes simplex, and cryptosporidosis. The
causes, locations, symptoms and treatments for some of these conditions are

Medication Therapy For HIV
Significant advances in antiretroviral therapy have been made since the advent of the first US government-approved medication in 1987, zidovudine
(AZT). With the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART), HIV-1 infection has become a chronic, manageable disease for
individuals with stable suppression of the virus and access to treatment.
HAART is the combination of several antiretroviral medicines used to slow
the rate at which HIV multiplies in the body. A combination of three or more
antiretroviral medicines (often referred to as a “cocktail”) is more effective
than using just one medicine (monotherapy) to treat the virus. The current
recommendation for starting HAART in the United States is to begin therapy
when the CD4+ T cell count falls to 500cells/ml or below. There are sources
that have also indicated that, in mid– and low income countries, initiation of
therapy is recommended for a CD4+ T cell count of 350cells/ml or below.
Anti-retroviral medications generally target or interfere with steps in the
reproductive cycle of the virus. There are 6 classes of anti-retroviral medications currently available:
1) Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)
2) Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)
3) Protease Inhibitors (PIs)
4) Integrase Inhibitors (IIs)
5) Fusion Inhibitors (FIs)
6) Chemokine Receptor Antagonists (CRAs).
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
153
The use of these medications depends on a variety of factors including simplicity or complexity of use, efficacy determined by clinical evidence, sideeffect profile, practice guidelines, and clinician preference. Particular concerns that play a role in which medications are initiated or used for maintenance therapy include adverse effects, co-infection with hepatitis B virus or
hepatitis C virus, pregnancy, and resistance. Outlined below and on subsequent pages are lists of antiretroviral medications currently in use.

While antiretroviral therapy can help control proliferation of the virus and
allow the body to recover its ability to fight infections, it is not a cure. If antiretroviral therapy is discontinued, the virus will recur. Other reasons for treatment failure may include drugs or herbal preparations that interfere and reduce the level of antiretroviral medication in the system; a patient’s being too
ill (i.e. overwhelmed by not only HIV infection but also other infections or
illnesses); an individual’s inability to tolerate the medicine (e.g. due to significant side effects); resistance; or poor adherence to the prescribed medications.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
157
Resistance
HIV makes every effort to survive in the body. If there is anti-retroviral
medication in the system but not at a level to effectively disable the virus,
the virus can potentially mutate or change to a form that can resist the effects
of the medication. This capacity to change and resist medication effects is
termed resistance. Resistance is an important reason why HIV drugs stop
working. Missed doses of medication or continuing on a drug regimen that
is not effective can encourage resistance. Interactions with other medicines
that reduce HIV medication in the system or a poor ability to absorb HIV
medication into the bloodstream can also contribute to resistance.
Adherence
The risk of resistance may be reduced by maintaining adherence to the antiretroviral medicines prescribed. Adherence, in simple terms, means the ability to take medications as prescribed. Specifically, adherence involves a)
taking the appropriate anti-retroviral drugs; b) taking the drugs on the appropriate schedule; and c) taking the drugs in the correct manner (e.g. with or
without food). One hundred percent adherence is required for treatment to
be effective. With precise adherence, antiretroviral therapy will be successful. With poor adherence continued viral replication and increased viral load
may occur, the CD4+ T cell count may decrease (increasing the risk for opportunistic infections), and the potential for resistance may emerge. It can
be challenging for individuals to maintain 100% adherence. Adherence
counselling provides those with difficulty support and techniques to improve
and maintain adherence. Specific techniques are outlined in a subsequent
section of this chapter.

158
HIV & Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)
 Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections that are passed
from one individual to another through sexual contact. The infections may
be caused by varied pathogens such as viruses (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) or bacteria (e.g. syphilis, gonorrhea). STDs may increase a person’s risk for
becoming infected with HIV by causing conditions that allow easier passage of the virus into the body (e.g. passage through open sores, ulcers,
and irritations). The inflammatory process (resulting from damage by
certain STDs to the skin surface) increases the presence and concentration
of immune cells to the area that can serve as targets for HIV (e.g. CD4+
cells). In addition, those infected with HIV, who contract subsequent
STDs, are at increased risk of transmitting the virus to sexual partners.
Studies indicate that those infected with HIV and also have other STDs
can shed the virus in their genital secretions. The higher the concentration
of HIV in genital fluids, the more likely the virus may be spread to a partner.

Contracting an STD may have serious implications for one who is HIVpositive. Some STDs are curable or eradicated with antibiotic treatment
(e.g. gonorrhea, syphilis). However, others may not be eradicated fully
and may be associated with potentially fatal diseases such as cancer (HPV,
Hep C) and liver failure (Hep B, Hep C). The table on the next page outlines a number of STDs that have been associated with HIV.

distractibility, changes in mood and personality, and impaired judgment. Dementia may be caused by varied conditions such as degenerative brain diseases (e.g. Alzheimer’s Disease), vascular (blood vessel) disease, or chronic
alcohol or drug abuse. The onset of dementia is typically insidious or slow
lasting months to years. Dementias that involve ongoing degeneration or destruction of brain tissue are usually irreversible.
HIV may directly damage brain tissue leading to a dementia-like syndrome.
Over the years, several names have been attached to more severe and milder
aspects of HIV-related dementia and have included AIDS dementia complex
(ADC), HIV associated dementia (HAD), HIV-encephalopathy, subacute encephalitis, HIV cognitive/motor complex (HIV CMC), minor cognitive-motor
disorder, and HIV associated neurocognitive disease (HAND).
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
161
The dementia associated with HIV can develop over weeks or chronically
over years. Symptoms may be similar to those associated with other types of
dementia and include decreased short-term memory, decreased attention and
concentration, disturbance in word finding, decelerated thought processing,
psychomotor retardation (i.e. slowed movement), impaired reasoning and intellect, and, in advanced disease, impaired visual-spatial function (i.e. aspect
of brain function that analyzes and understands space in two and three dimensions). Personality changes and mood disturbances such as depression may
occur. Less commonly, manic symptoms (agitation, irritability, impulsivity,
and excessive talkativeness) and psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, irrational suspiciousness, or paranoia) may be present. Motor deficits (i.e. impaired movement) are also a part of the HIV-related dementia syndrome and
may include muscle weakness, increased or decreased muscle tone, spasticity
movements, muscle rigidity or “cogwheeling,” and over or under- reactive
reflexes.
A complete medical and psychiatric evaluation are important in evaluating an
individual with HIV who presents with neurocognitive symptoms. Where
available, laboratory tests (e.g. complete blood count, CD4 count, HIV viral
load, chemistry screen, urinalysis, blood/urine cultures, ECG, chest x-ray, and,
when applicable, drug toxicology screen, thyroid function tests, and B6 & B12
vitamin levels) and neuroimaging (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging or MRI)
are used in the evaluation of HIV-related dementia.
HIV-related dementia has been treatable. That is, symptoms may be reduced
with anti-retroviral therapy. Specific psychiatric symptoms of the dementia
syndrome may be addressed with particular treatments as well. For example,
if agitation has developed and is severe, low dose antipsychotic may be used
(e.g. olanzapine or seroquel if available or chlorpromazine). Low dose antipsychotics may be used if hallucinations are present as well. Avoiding antipsychotics causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) is generally recommended.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
162
Use of antipsychotics in elderly individuals for psychosis related to other
(non HIV-related) dementias has not been recommended due to increased
risk of death. Caution is also taken with elderly people with HIV-related
dementia. Antidepressants are helpful in treating associated depression.
Benzodiazepines that are metabolized by the body in a relatively short period
(i.e. those with short half-lives such as lorazepam) may be useful for anxiety
and insomnia. However, it is important to be aware that benzodiazepines
have also been associated with uninhibited behavior (i.e. disinhibition) and
cognitive impairment. They should be used short-term and in the lowest effective doses.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
163
b) CNS infections and tumors
Individuals with significant HIV disease may be prone to central nervous
system (CNS) infections and tumors that can present with a combination of
neurological and psychiatric symptoms. These conditions are outlined in
detail below and include neurosyphilis, cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and CNS lymphoma.
Neurosyphilis
Syphilis is an infection caused by the spirochete, Treponema pallidum, and
has several stages of disease. The primary stage is characterized by
enlarged lymph nodes in the groin region and a painless “chancre” or sore
that may be located on the genitals. This may disappear without treatment
but secondary syphilis characterized by fever, swollen lymph nodes, rash,
and genital lesions may appear after approximately 2 years. During this
stage a syphilitic meningitis with headache, nausea, stiff neck, and occasional cranial nerve deficits, may occur. However, more commonly, there
are no neurological symptoms but diagnostic tests analyzing spinal fluid
may be abnormal. The latent or next phase is also characterized by abnormal diagnostic blood tests and minimal clinical symptoms.
The last stage or tertiary phase is when neurosyphilis (syphilis affecting
brain tissue) occurs. During this phase other organs including the heart and
eyes my be affected as well. Neurosyphilis may present with or without
symptoms , however diagnostic tests (of spinal fluid) remain abnormal.
Syphilis in this stage may cause meningitis or a stroke. There may also be
syphilitic dementia associated with seizures, mania, agitation, and grandiose
delusional thoughts. Tabes dorsalis (ataxia/loss of balance, lower extremity
paresthesia and paresis, hyporeflexia, incontinence, and
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
164
sharp pains) may occur. “Gummas” or degenerated brain tissue surrounded
by thick, fiber-like tissue may, on rare occasion, lead to a space-occupying
brain mass.

Syphilis may be suspected or detected through tests including VDRL
(Venereal Disease Research Laboratory), RPR (rapid plasma reagent), MHATP (microhemiagglutination – assay for treponema pallidum), and FTA
(fluorescent treponemal antibody). In some instances lumbar puncture may
be indicated. Treatment with antibiotics is effective.
Cryptococcal Meningitis
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that commonly causes meningitis
(swelling of the protective outer-sheath of the brain) in AIDS patients.
Symptoms may occur within days or weeks. Early symptoms may be fever,
lethargy, persistent, progressive headache; seizure and delirium may occur.
Stiff neck typically associated with other types of meningitis is not necessarily present. Some individuals may develop focal neurological symptoms
including paralysis of cranial nerves causing blindness and deafness, partial
muscle weakness, and over-active reflexes.
 Treated or untreated, the disease may progress to produce complications
including seizure, stroke, swelling of the brain, and coma. Permanent nerve
damage and dementia may be long-lasting complications. Cryptococcus is
detected usually by analyzing blood and spinal fluid for presence of the fungus. Antifungal antibiotics are used as treatment.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
165
Toxoplasmosis
Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the parasite, Toxoplasma gondii.
It is characterized by multiple abcesses that cause swelling of brain tissue
or encephalitis.
Initial symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and flulike symptoms such as headache, fever, malaise. Localized neurological
signs may be present and include partial muscle weakness, partial loss of
sensation, partial loss of sight, inability to comprehend or communicate
speech, memory loss, and seizure. Delirium may develop with disease
progression. Nausea, vomiting, and lethargy may be an indication of increased pressure within the skull as the brain tissue continually inflames.
If available, a computerized tomography (CT ) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may reveal the presence of the disease (ring-enhancing
lesions). Anti-parasitic medication has been an effective treatment.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Encephalitis
CMV belongs to the family of Herpes viruses and in addition to neurological disease is associated with disease of the eyes, lungs, esophagus, intestines, and adrenal gland. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of CMV include
primarily encephalitis (global swelling or inflammation of brain tissue).
Symptoms associated with encephalitis include fever, headache, lethargy,
delirium, dementia, seizure, and coma. Occasionally facial and ocular cranial nerve impairments, and weakness of the lower limbs occurs. A definitive diagnosis is made through brain biopsy (analysis of a sample of brain
tissue). The recommended treatment is antiviral medication.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
166
Aseptic Meningitis
A form of meningitis may occur where no pathogen or germ is evident on
diagnostic analysis (i.e. no bacteria evident in spinal fluid). This has been
referred to as aseptic meningitis. Symptoms may emerge within days to
weeks and include headache with or without stiff neck or fever, lethargy
and delirium. Rarely impairment of the cranial nerve that controls movements of the facial muscles occurs.
If available, a CT or MRI will indicate inflammation of the tissues that
make up a protective sheath enveloping the brain (meninges) and analysis
of the spinal fluid will be abnormal.
There is no specific treatment – however the condition may resolve on its
own. Supportive measures (e.g. IV fluid), antiretroviral therapy, pain
medication, and steroids are used empirically.
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
PML is caused by a virus (John Cunningham or JC virus) that infects and
destroys oligodendrocytes (i.e. CNS cells that produce a protective cover
that aids the transmission of nervous impulses from one nerve cell to another) and other supportive cells (astrocytes). Neurological and psychiatric symptoms have included impaired cognition (e.g. memory and concentration), weakness and sensory loss, impaired vision, slurred speech, loss
of muscle coordination, dizziness, seizures, inability to understand or communicate speech, inability to read, and inability to recognize faces.
If available, an MRI is preferred to CT as lesions in white matter of the
brain will be more evident. The prognosis for PML is poor although some
antiretroviral medications have been associated with prolonged life.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
167
Primary CNS Lymphoma
Central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma associated with AIDS occurs most
commonly when there is severe immunodeficiency. Symptoms include headache, seizure, lethargy, and delirium. Focal or localized neurological signs
are not uncommon and may include impaired capacity to understand or communicate speech, muscle weakness, and cranial nerve deficits. If available, a
CT or MRI scan may reveal one or more homogenous, mass lesions. Treatment involves radiation, steroids, and/or chemotherapy.
c) Other Medical Conditions & Medications
Other medical conditions seen in HIV-infected individuals causing psychiatric
symptoms have included kidney disease (HIV-associated nephropathy and end
-stage renal disease), liver disease (hepatitis C, cirrhosis), and endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypotestosteronism, and adrenal insufficiency). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can be toxic and cause neurobehavioral disturbances. In particular, efavirenz has been associated with cognitive changes, headache, dizziness, insomnia, nightmares, and even suicidal
thought. Symptoms appear to be related to blood levels and tend to decrease
gradually over time, however. HIV-infected individuals who are taking interferon for treatment of coinfection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be at
risk for depression. Antidepressant medication is indicated if depressive
symptoms are persistent and debilitating.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
168
Psychiatric Illnesses Associated with HIV/AIDS
According to western studies (United States), psychiatric illnesses occurring commonly in individuals with HIV or AIDS include depression, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorder, and substance abuse. With certain conditions, mania and psychosis have also been observed.
Studies from the United States have indicated that depression and suicidal
thoughts and attempts may be increased in people infected with HIV. Risk
factors for suicide have included a recently positive HIV test, having lost
close friends to AIDS, poor social and financial support, continuous relapses of medical illnesses associated with HIV, and the presence of dementia or delirium.
According to American studies, anxiety disorders that occur with frequency in individuals with HIV have included generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. An
adjustment disorder, according to the DSM V, is characterized by emotional or behavioral distress occurring in response to an identifiable
stressor within 3 months of the stressor. Adjustment disorder with anxiety or depressive features has been associated with HIV and AIDS.
Substance abuse may play a role in putting individuals at risk for contracting HIV or may occur as a means of self-medicating distress after infection has been realized. Intravenous drug abuse or sharing contaminated
drug paraphernalia remains a significant mode of HIV transmission
throughout the world. People who abuse substances are at risk for engaging in unsafe sexual practices which contributes to the spread of the disease. People with HIV who do not have access to mental health services
may abuse substances in order to cope with stress, further complicating or
perpetuating HIV disease and emotional distress.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
169
Studies have indicated that mania has been associated with opportunistic
infections (e.g. cryptococcal meningitis) and medications (e.g. efavirnez).
In addition, it has occured as an aspect of HIV-associated dementia. For
those with a pre-existing bipolar disorder, an exacerbation of symptoms
tends to occur most commonly, but not exclusively, in the context of HIVassociated dementia. Psychotic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations) have been
observed as an aspect of HIV-associated dementia .
The specific symptoms and treatments for depression, anxiety disorders,
adjustment disorder, substance abuse, and mania are outlined in previous
chapters. Regarding psychiatric medication therapy, drugs that are less
likely to interfere with or potentiate the side effects of anti-retroviral medicines are recommended.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
170
2. Psychological Issues
Common Emotions
Fear, uncertainty, anger, and guilt are emotions often experienced by individuals infected by HIV.
Individuals may be fearful and uncertain about the effect the virus will have
on their bodies and their lives in general. They may fear subsequent medical
tests, losing the capacity to function at full strength, and losing the support of
friends and family. Providing them education and information can reduce
fear and uncertainty. For example, directly teaching or referring individuals
to healthcare providers who can educate them about test procedures, medications, and recognizing symptoms of illness early can help them feel in
greater control of their circumstances. In addition helping them identify
reliable supports (family, friends, clergy, therapist, etc…) can allay fears of
abandonment.
Anger is common and may be rooted in a sense of unfairness. That is, an
individual may feel that he or she has been unduly afflicted. Anger may also
stem from a fear of losing control of one’s life or a fear of social stigma,
rejection, or abandonment. It will be important to help the patient understand that having anger is alright and a natural human response. The issue is
how the anger is managed. Helping the individual identify and utilize constructive, productive ways to discharge anger is imperative.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
171
Guilt is another emotion that is often experienced by individuals infected
with HIV. A person with HIV may feel that he or she has brought the virus
onto him or herself and should be blamed and punished. Some experience
guilt about introducing HIV into the lives of others. They may feel that they
have created burden and distress for spouses, partners, parents, children, or
friends. Individuals burdened with overwhelming guilt, should be counseled on how to detach negativity and punishment from the virus. Help
them understand that, in reality, the virus has nothing to do with punishment. Anyone, “good” or “bad,” has the potential to become infected. In
addition, reinforce patients’ self esteem and sense of worth. Having the patients remind themselves of who they are outside of having HIV can bolster
self confidence and esteem. Having them recall what people who love them
(i.e. family, partners, friends) like about them can reinforce self esteem.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
172
Loss of control
With the advent of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), people with HIV are living longer and may be less severely debilitated by
disease. HAART may contribute to one’s maintaining a sense of independence and control over his or her life. Emphasizing one’s capacity to function and providing reassurance and reinforcement of function can help
individuals living with HIV preserve self-esteem and self-worth.
Caregivers should allow patients to take the lead in expressing what feels
like too much or too little help. Those caring for individuals with HIV
disease may find it useful to listen without necessarily providing advice to
resolve a problem. Attending to non-verbal clues and keeping an open
channel of communication can be useful.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
173
Newly Diagnosed Individuals
Reactions will vary among people newly diagnosed with HIV. It will be
important to help the individual identify support that suits his or her individual needs (e.g. some utilize family, friends, mental health professionals,
literature about HIV disease, or spiritual resources). In addition, providing
factual, practical information will help dispel fear and uncertainty. Assessing the patient’s level of comfort with disclosing his or her HIV status
and the need to make previous partners aware is important.
Death & Dying
Despite the advances in treatment, in some areas of the world, HIV/AIDS
still remains a serious disease from which individuals may die.
Emotional responses to death and dying, including denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, have been described by Kubler-Ross and
are outlined in detail in the chapter on “Loss & Bereavement.” These
emotions are not necessarily experienced by patients in a particular sequence and caregivers may also experience these reactions. Helping both
patients and caregivers accept the limitations on what they can do or control within the situation is important. Helping individuals identify and
focus on the positives and reframe negative thoughts can be useful. Patients and caregivers should be encouraged to identify and actively incorporate into their lives those things that give them pleasure.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
174
3. Social Issues
 Women & HIV/AIDS
HIV and AIDS in women can significantly impact households and societies.
In many developing countries, women are the primary caregivers of the family. When the mother becomes ill, young daughters are often pulled from
school, forfeiting an education to help in the home. In some cultures, if a
woman loses her husband she may be at risk of losing land or property.
Faced with such a challenge, some women have been driven to prostitution
in exchange for food or other goods.
Social stigma
Social stigma is common in many societies and can interfere with family and
community support for individuals contracting disease. Individuals with
HIV or AIDS have the burden of being rejected by family and friends and
may even be accused of “contaminating’ or tainting a family’s name.
Poverty
In countries that are already poverty stricken, the AIDS epidemic may cause
households an even greater decline into complete destitution. Households
that are already impoverished may have difficulty overcoming additional
adversity. AIDS may cause the loss of productive household members resulting in loss of income.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
175
Decreased income means less ability to feed, cloth, or educate family members. In some instances families separate and children may be forced to start
working early to support the family.
High Medical Costs
The high medical costs associated with HIV and AIDS treatment can potentially devastate families and individuals in both developed and developing
countries. For example, in the United States, people with HIV/AIDS without insurance or other financial resources may be unable to access adequate
care. There are limitations on support for the indigent. Even for those who
have some form of health insurance, the high cost of medical services and
medications are not always adequately covered. Despite increases in funding for HIV/AIDS in recent years, many developing countries continue to
have limited access to services and medications.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
176
Specialized Counseling Associated With HIV/AIDS
HIV voluntary counseling & testing (VCT)
a. HIV counseling
The aim of HIV counseling is to decrease the acquisition and transmission
of HIV through providing effective information and prevention counseling .
Information
 It is suggested that all who are recommended or request HIV testing receive
information that includes the risk factors for transmission; how to prevent
transmission; benefits of getting tested; the consequences of not testing if
one is at risk; importance of and explicit instructions on how to obtain test
results; the meaning or interpretation of results; how and where to obtain
additional information about HIV; and how and where to obtain additional
services if indicated (e.g. medical, psychological, social services).
Information should always be provided in a manner that is appropriate to
culture, language, age, and developmental level. While face-to-face, clientcounselor sessions are recommended for prevention counseling, pamphlets
or videos are appropriate (and an efficient means) for providing information
about HIV.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
177
Prevention counseling
There have been a number of proficient models for HIV prevention counseling. The client-centered HIV prevention counseling approach has been
shown to be both efficient and effective. Client-centered counseling focuses on the client’s own unique situation and involves helping the client
outline and achieve an explicit behavior change goal to decrease the
chance of acquiring or transmitting HIV. For individuals taking the standard HIV test, the client-centered approach involves two brief, in-person
or face-to-face sessions with a health provider or counselor. In the first
session, an assessment of the client’s personal HIV risk is made; a risk
behavior (if any) and action to change that behavior is identified and discussed; the HIV test is performed; and the client is asked to return in 2
weeks for results.
In the second session, progress made in changing the previously identified
risk behavior is discussed, additional behavior change actions are outlined
as needed, HIV test results are provided and discussed, and referral to additional services is offered as indicated.
With rapid testing, there may be either one or two sessions depending on
test results. Individuals with preliminary positive rapid HIV test results
will have another session when they return for their confirmatory results.
Clients at risk for HIV but with negative rapid HIV test results receive one
session of counseling that includes a risk-reduction plan. While not obligated to return, they should be offered the opportunity to come back for a
follow-up session to discuss their efforts to implement the plan.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
178
 Client-centered HIV Prevention Counseling – Session #1
1st SESSION
1. Assess the client’s personal risk for HIV. What in particular puts this individual at risk for HIV? Ask in a non-judgmental way and use active, attentive
listening to determine whether the client engages in risk behaviors such as
unprotected sex with others who may be at risk for HIV; abuse of intravenous
drugs or other mind-altering substances that could alter judgment or has had
blood transfusions or exposure to contaminated blood products. Risk also
involves one’s maintaining misconceptions such as the belief that he or she
could never be afflicted or that their culture or society could never understand
or accept using precautions against HIV. It is important to help the client
identify and understand these “risks” as well. Discuss in a sensitive manner
the circumstances that put them at risk. Remember that this is not the time to
discuss the meaning of test results (this is covered at another point in the counseling process). Also, the counselor should not engage in discussions of additional problems unrelated to the client’s specific HIV risk factors (discussing
other illnesses, social problems, etc…). There will be another time in the
counseling process to address these issues as well.
 2. Explore attempts already made to reduce risk behaviors. If the client already engaged in risk-reducing behavior, acknowledge his or her success.
Also, encourage discussion of the challenges that made decreasing risk behavior difficult and discuss how these challenges were managed.

3. If there is an identifiable risk factor (e.g. unprotected sex) and action has not
been taken already to decrease the risky behavior, discuss a specific, concrete
action that can help reduce the risk (e.g. provide information on the proper use
of and how to obtain condoms and ask the client to use them between now and
the time he returns for the HIV test results).
4. Describe, discuss, and answer questions regarding the HIV testing process.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
179
2nd SESSION

1. Discuss the progress made in changing the previously identified risk
behavior.
2. Identify additional risk behaviors and outline concrete actions to
change the behaviors (as indicated).
3. Provide and discuss the meaning of the HIV test results (see the section
on the next page on “HIV Testing”).
Offer referral to additional services, as indicated (i.e. medical, psychological,
social).

b. HIV testing
The HIV test is designed to detect antibodies to the virus. A confirmed positive test result indicates that antibodies are present and that HIV infection has
occurred. Test kits used currently have the capacity to screen varied body
fluids including blood products (whole blood, serum, and plasma), oral fluid,
and urine (see the table on the next page). Factors influencing the type of test
kit used by a health facility may include the ease of sample collection, cost,
accuracy or sensitivity of the test, client preferences and acceptability, and the
likelihood of clients returning for results.

Positive HIV Test Results
If an initial HIV test result is positive, additional confirmatory tests are
done to verify the result (i.e. Western Blot Test with results available in 2
weeks). An HIV test is considered positive only after both the initial and
confirmatory tests are positive. A confirmed positive test is an indication
that HIV infection has occurred.
Negative HIV Test Results
A negative HIV test result strongly indicates the absence of HIV infection
and does not warrant repeating unless there has been new exposure to an
infected partner (or partner of unknown HIV status) or exposure to other
risk factors (e.g. contaminated drug paraphernalia; working with potentially contaminated blood products or body fluids). An HIV test may be
falsely negative if the test was performed prior to seroconversion (i.e. before an individual exposed to virus has developed detectable antibodies to
the virus). After exposure to the virus, it may take 4 – 12 weeks before the
body develops HIV antibodies that will be detectable by testing. In this
situation, individuals should be instructed to repeat the test in 3 months. If
the result is negative yet concern still remains (e.g. if one is sure that he or
she has had sexual contact with an infected person or contact with contaminated body fluids) another test may be performed 6 months after the
exposure.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
183
Adherence Counseling
The ability to take medications as prescribed is termed adherence. One hundred percent adherence is required for antiretroviral medication therapy to
be effective. With poor adherence continued viral replication may occur
and the CD4+ T cell count may continue to decrease, increasing the risk for
opportunistic infections and advanced disease. In addition, non-adherence
can lead to resistance (where the HIV changes in character or “mutates” and
becomes resistant to a medication’s previous effect) resulting in treatment
failure. Managing adherence to antiretroviral medication therapy can be a
significant challenge for people with HIV disease. Outlined below are a
few direct and indirect measures utilized to monitor medication adherence.
 Measures of Medication Adherence
 Viral load testing
 Pill counts MEMS (medication event monitoring system) bottle cap
 Self report tools
 One-on-one direct interview by counselor
 Reports from caregivers
 Pharmacy tracking of medication pickup/delivery
 Clinic visits
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
184
Adherence counseling involves identifying and addressing patient, provider,
and medication regimen factors that may contribute to one’s difficulty in
taking antiretroviral medication as prescribed.
Patient factors contributing to non-adherence
a) Patient commitment and readiness for treatment.
b) Social demographics – stability of living situation and work schedule
are important factors.
c) Psychological factors – depression; psychoactive drug abuse may
interfere with adherence to antiretroviral medication.
d) Individual cultural/religious beliefs – beliefs around the need or use
of medication may influence adherence.
e) Physical factors - presence of other medical illnesses.
Management of patient factors :
a) Evaluate and develop patient’s knowledge and understanding of the
need for antiretroviral therapy.
b) Evaluate patient’s motivation and commitment to antiretroviral therapy. Peer interventions (interactions with and education from others who are managing HIV disease) have been shown to be effective.
c) Assess and address mental health issues and behavioral/coping skills
with appropriate referrals to support.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
185
Provider factors contributing to non-adherence
a) General support and support when a change in medication therapy is
warranted.
b) Patient education.
c) Medication reminders.
d) Use of multidisciplinary team when possible so that care and support
can be comprehensive.
e) Ongoing support – studies indicate that adherence diminishes over
time when interaction or support from providers is diminished.
f) Access to obstetric and pediatric care as indicated.
Management of provider factors:
a) Providers must offer: education about HIV disease; the need for antiretroviral therapy; the relationship between adherence, resistance, and treatment
failure; and significant effects and side effects of medication.
b) Adherence interventions should be offered at the beginning, at points of
change, and throughout an established course of therapy.
c) Medication pill boxes, MEMS (medication event monitoring system) bottle caps, alarms, calendars, diaries, phone reminders, and incentive items
(gifts) should be utilized as indicated to help patients keep track of their
medicines.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
186
d) A multidisciplinary team approach should be utilized to foster a wellrounded view and management of the patient.
Medication regimen factors contributing to non-adherence
a) individual history and lifestyle which will vary and influence choices
of therapy;
b) dosing frequency;
c) drug class pill burden; drug interactions and side effects.
Management of medication regimen factors:
a) Evaluation of lifestyle such as eating, sleeping, and work patterns.
b) Evaluating a patient’s preferences regarding pill size and number of pills
to be taken.
c) Potential for drug interactions and side effects should be carefully assessed.

187
HIV/AIDS & Disaster/Emergency Settings
Emergency situations such as armed conflicts (war) or natural disasters have
the potential to create conditions that make people vulnerable to disease.
Challenges within the emergency setting associated with the spread of HIV
have included increased economic hardship; disabled health, social and educational services; disabled monitoring and maintenance of blood supply;
increased drug abuse; and violent sexual crimes.
Increased Economic Hardship
Economic hardship can increase vulnerability to HIV. In armed conflict
situations widows and children left behind may become vulnerable and with
little protection. They may become targets of sexual abuse. In addition,
women who are left with no means to support themselves, following the loss
of family or possessions, may resort to prostitution for survival, potentially
increasing the risk of infection.
Disabled Health, Social, & Educational Services
During emergencies people may not be able to receive adequate healthcare
because facilities are poorly supplied, have been destroyed, or have closed
down. Healthcare personnel may have been lost or internally displaced.
Similarly, institutions and personnel used to educate people about HIV/
AIDS may be affected.
III: Conditions & Issues: HIV/AIDS & Mental Health
188
Disabled Monitoring & Maintenance of Blood Supply
During emergencies, health services may no longer have the capacity to
screen blood products adequately and sometimes are forced to recycle existing supplies such as gloves and needles. Although efforts are made to maintain good hygiene and sanitation, the risk for contamination may be increased.
Increased Drug Abuse
In the emergency setting people may become homeless and forced onto the
streets where there is greater exposure and access to illicit drugs. Law enforcement services may be disabled making it easier for illegal drugs to be
trafficked and sold to greater numbers of people.
Violent Sexual Crimes
Law enforcement agencies may function less efficiently and effectively during emergencies compromising the safety of individuals within communities.
In armed conflict situations, women may be at increased risk for being sexually assaulted. Increases in violent crimes such as rape may be seen.

Mental health counseling is an important intervention for helping
people maintain mental wellness. Counseling is focused on educating, guiding, and referring people in the community to psychological support services as opposed to psychotherapy where professional therapists administer established formal techniques.
Specifically, counseling involves empathic listening, understanding the basic signs of psychological distress, and problem solving
skills including basic advice on how to cope with distress, and obtain a more detailed evaluation and treatment if necessary. Counselors also provide individuals, families, and the community with
information about mental wellness and raise the public’s awareness of stigma and other key mental health issues through community education activities.
Individual Counseling
Counseling for individuals may aim to improve knowledge or to
provide an outlet for expressing feelings associated with mental
conditions. Basic counseling interventions for individuals are outlined in sections of the manual that discuss specific mental conditions.

Group Counseling
There are many different types of therapeutic groups. People can
come together on a variety of shared concerns, issues, and conditions. Some groups require a different approach from other groups
(e.g. a group focused on medical issues and their consequences ask
for a different approach than a group focused on psychological
issues or traumatic experiences). In some groups the group leaders
will find some participants who are eager to share their experiences and some who are hesitant to speak. The intellectual and
emotional levels of the groups may vary and therefore impact the
methods used and program planning. Some groups may be led by
professional psychotherapists while others, such as self help
groups, are initiated by facilitators with basic group support skills.
Self-help groups
A self-help group is a group of people with similar experiences
who meet on a regular basis to help each other to deal with issues
related to a health condition or specific experience. People with
similar experiences can help each other in the healing process. In
self-help groups people can find support, attention, and other participants who can be examples of how to deal with problems.
These groups are usually flexible and without a set number of sessions. Participants may attend when they want and facilitation or
leadership of the group is less structured. Self help groups may be
useful as a single supportive intervention or in combination with
other interventions such as individual counseling.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
191
The purpose of self help groups is to provide a means for:
1) Sharing information and knowledge about a problem;
2) meeting others who can empathize because of having a
similar experience;
3) support and empowerment;
4) recognition and acknowledgement;
5) self expression and making contact;
6) regaining self confidence;
7) learning alternative constructive coping methods.
Advantages and ways that self-help groups may differ from professional psychotherapy groups include:
1) Leaders and participants have had similar experiences and both
openly share their experiences. There is less potential for power
differences between facilitator and group members.
2) Self-help groups may be less expensive (and therefore more
accessible) as professional therapists may charge significant fees
for their services.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
192
Possible disadvantages of self help groups include:
1) Potential periods where emotional turbulence and conflict between group members is less controlled since there is less structure
and professional guidance;
2) No guarantee of continuity since regular attendance is not a set
rule and group leadership can change frequently;
3) Screening participants is limited, so there may be difficulty in
managing the needs of individuals who have emotional or intellectual capacities that vary significantly from other group members;
4) In acutely stressful situations such as situations of massive loss,
people may find that sharing experiences with others amplifies
their distress rather than reduces it.
How to lead a self help group
Usually groups are led by two co-leaders who have had experiences similar to other group members and who have been participants in a self help group in the past. The advantage of having two
leaders is that they can be a support for one another when difficult
issues emerge, the group can continue uninterrupted if one leader
must miss a session, and logistical organizational tasks may be
shared.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
193
It is important for group leaders to have some basic knowledge of
psychological conditions so that additional supportive resources
may be offered to individuals who appear to have additional needs.
During group sessions it is common for individuals to express
strong emotions (e.g. anger) and it is also common for overall
themes or attitudes to emerge from the group as a whole (e.g.
“scape-goating” - the group appears to “gang up on” or blame a
particular member for a conflict or distress that has emerged within
the group).
Other common problems that arise in groups include one individual dominating the discussion, individuals selectively withdrawing
or refusing to speak, or individuals being excluded from the discussion. It is important that leaders have an awareness and basic
knowledge of problematic emotions and themes – sometimes these
emotions and themes can be so strong that the group becomes distracted and led astray from the constructive purpose of their gathering. Group leaders can play a role in helping the group recognize, acknowledge, and keep in perspective the strong emotions
and themes.
The group leaders must be in a place in their lives where they have
come to terms with or placed in perspective the thoughts and feelings they have had related to their own distressing experience or
life event. Being in the group setting with others in distress can
potentially trigger difficult emotions. The group leaders need to be
able to recognize and manage these situations without adding emotional burden to vulnerable group members. The goal for the selfhelp leaders is to initiate the group or start them on a path to expressing and operating independently or without facilitation.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
194
Managing self-help sessions
Sessions may be started by having participants share their name
(usually first name only for the sake of privacy) and their reason
for coming to the group. Group “rules” should be mentioned so
that members have an idea about what is expected from them and
from others. It should be emphasized that the purpose of outlining
rules is not to be controlling, but to create an environment where
respect and expectations are equal for all. Again, self-help groups
are flexible – people may attend when they want and as many sessions as they want. Self-help groups are usually open to all with a
similar experience and ongoing. It should be clear what time the
group starts and ends, how often the group meets, and where the
group is to be held regularly (i.e. the usual location). Asking group
members to respect one another’s privacy is important (i.e. do not
share members information with people not involved in the group).
Also, the leaders should emphasize that violence of any kind (e.g.
physical assault or verbal attack) is not acceptable and grounds for
dismissal from the group.
The participants should be encouraged to share the actual experiences that have caused distress, how these experiences have impacted their lives and function, and the emotions they have felt as a
result. The point of the group is to have members realize that they
are not alone and that it is human and natural to experience emotions that can feel negative or painful. The group discussions
should also help people develop an awareness of their own
strengths and serve as an environment where they are constantly
reminded of their strengths. In addition, hearing about ways that
others have coped can help individuals increase and enhance their
own methods of coping.
When individuals express strong emotions, such as anger, allow
them to express openly. Their feelings should be acknowledged.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
195
Others who can relate to the individual’s emotions should share
these feelings. In addition, people should be allowed to express
their feelings about seeing another express anger. Allowing group
members to talk about how they have managed this emotion is
important. The methods mentioned by the group that have led to a
sense of hope and peace should be emphasized. If there is excessive aggression or potential for abuse – remind the entire group
members of the ground rules about violence and aggression.
After a number of sessions (the actual number will vary from
group to group) members should have developed an idea about the
purpose, structure, and operation of the group. The goal for coleaders is to transfer this understanding, withdraw ultimately as
facilitators, and allow the group to run independently.
Family Support
Family members are often the caretakers of individuals with mental conditions. They may provide the emotional and physical support and may also manage the economic expenses related to mental
health treatments and care. Being exposed to distress, family
members are vulnerable to becoming distressed. In addition, they
may become victims of stigma by association - they may be rejected by others in the community who do not understand mental
conditions, leading to a feeling of isolation and limited social activity.
Providing families with specific information and practical methods
of support is important. Teaching family members about signs and
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
196
symptoms of a condition, treatments, and what to expect (or not
expect) from treatments is necessary. Providing advice on how to
structure time and their living environments to reduce stress is
helpful. Family members may find it useful to meet with a group
of others who share the same situation as a means for emotional
support.
Questions Families Commonly Ask:
1. Will he/she recover?
2. Can he/she work?
3. Can he/she live at home?
4. Will he/she have to take medications for life?
5. Can he/she have children?
6. (In conflict and disaster situations) Will this experience (loss, disaster, stressful event) make
him/her mentally ill?
The answers to these questions may come from varied clinicians.
It is important that the healthcare provider (whether it is a nurse,
doctor, or mental health aide) do his or her best to address the
questions directly or refer the family to the appropriate resources
and providers who can address the questions.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
197
Community Education
Community education & the stigma of mental illness
People who are different from the norm within a society may experience stigma by others who feel uneasy, embarrassed, or too
threatened to talk about behavior they perceive as different. Feelings of shame, disgrace, or rejection can occur in those who are
stigmatized.
The stigma surrounding mental illness is strong, has placed a wall
of silence around the issue, and can be attributed to misbelief about
mental conditions, misconceptions about psychiatric medications,
and poor tolerance of the community of people with mental illness.
Stigma towards people with a mental illness can have a detrimental
effect on their ability to obtain services, their recovery, the type of
treatment and support they receive, and their acceptance in the
community.
Reducing stigma means empowering those with mental conditions
and changing the attitudes of uninformed people in the community.
It is important to highlight the individual’s positive aspects and his
or her capacity to make contributions to the family and society.
Encourage the person to take part in the community.
A counselor can be a good model for the community by treating
those suffering from mental conditions with empathy, humanity,
dignity, and respect and relating to the person, not the illness.
Modeling or demonstrating positive communication skills towards
the individual when other people are present is a way to teach others how to interact appropriately and respectfully.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
198
Liaising and building up trusting relationships with the families of
those affected, fosters understanding and decreases frustration.
Lastly, organizing activities or talks within the community to raise
awareness about mental health, illness, and stigma can improve
knowledge and tolerance.

Community Psychosocial Development Through Psychosocial
Activities
Communities impacted by significant social stressors (e.g. chronic
poverty, social/political conflict, armed conflict, natural disaster)
can benefit from interventions aimed to stabilize, maintain, or develop the community’s social structure and function. A community’s social state is influenced by the psychological and social
well-being of its members. Community psychosocial development
involves helping communities organize activities, events, and projects (that members in engage in as a group) to foster social or relational well-being between individuals and psychological wellbeing within individuals. Psychosocial activities, events, and projects may serve as the modes or venues to bring members together
to understand the facts, identify relevant issues, and devise effective solutions related to significant social stressors. Good psychosocial development of the community depends on the active participation of community members in identifying their priorities and
deciding on solutions.
Purpose of psychosocial activities, events, & projects
For communities impacted by significant social stressors, psychosocial activities, events, and projects may play a role in:
1) Reestablishing a sense of normalcy;
2) Rebuilding social ties between individuals and reestablishing
functioning social networks;
3) Helping community members gain knowledge and place in perspective the facts associated with the significant social stressors;
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
200
4) Helping community members identify the relevant, priority problems and issues related to the social stressor;
5) Helping the community develop effective, culture-appropriate
interventions to manage the problems and issues;
6) Helping members identify and institute culture-appropriate means
for generally empowering or increasing the capacity to affect their
circumstances, enrich their individual lives, and enrich the structure
and function of their communities.
Helping communities organize psychosocial activities, events, &
projects
The process of organizing psychosocial activities, events, and projects should stem from the community and will vary from one cultural group to another. Outlined below are a few suggestions on how
to facilitate the organizational process:
1. Meet with community members or representatives to
assess the interest and desire for psychosocial activities,
events, or projects.
2. Provide information on the purpose and potential benefits of organizing psychosocial activities, events, and
projects.
3. Identify and collaborate with existing groups, organizations, or individuals who have been playing a role already in addressing the social stressors and organizing
supportive activities.
4. Support and respect community members’ participation
in identifying their priorities and determining solutions
considered effective.
III: Conditions & Issues: Counseling Guide
201
Examples of psychosocial activities, events, & projects fostering
community psychosocial development
A variety of modes or venues may be used to foster support and
psychosocial development in communities affected by significant
social stressors. Modes or venues have included recreational, cultural, educational, and work-related activities (events and projects)
that are didactic and creative in nature. Listed below are a few examples:
1. Recreational activities (e.g. sports, games,
hobbies).
2. Cultural events (e.g. musical concerts and
other artistic performances; art exhibits).
3. Educational projects (e.g. lectures; mobile
libraries; academic school quizzes/competitions).
4. Work-related projects (e.g. job training seminars; development of business organizations and
networks).

MEDICATION GUIDE
The guide is intended for use by authorized prescribers only. Medications included in this section are mainly from lists of essential psychotropic medicines recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO)
for use in settings where mental health care is limited or nonexistent.
General prescribing principles
1. Prior to prescribing medication be clear about the psychiatric diagnosis and target symptoms.
2. Be aware of underlying medical conditions, alcohol & drug abuse, or
drug-drug interactions that may be a factor in the presenting psychiatric
symptoms.
3. Be clear about expected side effects, potential drug interactions and
potential for dependence.
4. Ask patients about other medications they are taking including self
prescribed or herbal remedies and caution them against combining
medications or consulting other practitioners without informing the prescriber.
5. Pursue full medication trials with adequate doses and duration of treatment.
6. Monitor side effects.
7. Make efforts to simplify medication regimens to encourage compliance.
8. Avoid poly-pharmacy (multiple or redundant medications).
9. Adjust doses appropriately for special populations such as the elderly
and children.
10. Keep records of patient response & side effects throughout the treatment course.

Other Antipsychotic Medications
While medications from the WHO Model List of Essential
Medicines (in addition to a few drugs with different properties) have been presented previously, several other antipsychotic medications have been developed and utilized for the
treatment of psychotic conditions (e.g. schizophrenia). These
medications are listed in the table below.
III: Conditions & Issues: Medication Guide
209
Special notes regarding antipsychotic medications
1) Remission of chronic, severe psychotic symptoms may require
at least 4-6 weeks of antipsychotic medication therapy.
2) EPS = extra-pyramidal symptoms (tremor; akathisia or a subjective sense of physical restlessness; muscular stiffness or
”cogwheel” rigidity; shuffling walking pattern; stooped posture;
drooling or uncontrolled seepage of saliva from the mouth). Observation (e.g. viewing for tremors, drooling, stooped posture, and
a shuffling walking pattern) and physical examination ( e.g. flexing
the elbow joints and feeling the arm muscles for tightness or rigidity) are ways to detect symptoms. Studies (western research) indicate that EPS is more common with high potency typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol and fluphenazine) than with low potency
antipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine). High
doses of antipsychotic medication are associated with an increased
risk for EPS. Western studies (United States) have found that
symptoms are more common in men under the age of 35 who have
muscular body types. EPS typically occur within the first 4 weeks
of antipsychotic use and are reversible with discontinuation of the
drug. Symptoms may disappear within days to months after antipsychotic medication has been stopped. If a patient needs to remain
on medication to control severe psychotic symptoms, EPS may be
reduced with anticholinergic medicines such as trihexyphenidyl or
diphenhydramine and, for akathisia specifically, propanolol and
benzodiazepines (i.e. diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam).
III: Conditions & Issues: Medication Guide
210
3) Tardive dyskinesia = involuntary, jerking or twisting motion of
muscles (usually head, limbs, or trunk); Tardive dyskinesia is irreversible and antipsychotic medication should be immediately discontinued if symptoms occur.
4) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) = can occur due to
antipsychotic medication especially in those with underlying medical illness. Symptoms include muscle rigidity; inability to move;
mutism; unstable blood pressure or heart rate; extremely high temperature; sweating & agitation. This condition is life-threatening
therefore medication must be discontinued immediately and emergent medical assistance must be sought.
5) Metabolic Syndrome = abnormalities in glucose metabolism,
lipid metabolism, body weight/fat distribution, and blood pressure
generally associated with schizophrenia and atypical antipsychotic
medications. Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should
be monitored for these conditions.

Medication Therapy For Depression
Antidepressant medications
Varied classes of antidepressant medication have been shown to be
effective for symptoms of depression. Each class acts differently
on neuro-chemical receptors (e.g. serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) in the brain to yield effects. The classes of antidepressant
medications commonly used include:
Alpha-2 antagonists (atypical)
Dopamine reuptake inhibitors (atypical)
MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitors)
SNRI (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors)
SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
Tetracyclics (act on varied receptors)
Tricyclics (act on varied receptors)
SSRI, SNRI, and atypicals are newer than tetracyclic and tricyclic
antidepressants and are associated with fewer side effects and less
lethality if taken in overdose.

NOTES FOR ALL ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS LISTED IN THIS SECTION:
1) Only common side effects are noted. Prescribers should check the medication literature for all potential side effects and drug interactions. 2) Children, the elderly, adults with small body composition, and
individuals with medical illness or nutritional deficiencies may require smaller initial & maintenance
doses for effect and may be more susceptible to side effects. 3) Studies in the United States have indicated
that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and
young adults age 18-24 with major depressive disorder. A number of agents are not approved in the
United States for use in the pediatric population. 4) For an explanation of the abbreviations included in

Medication Therapy for Mania/Bipolar Disorder
Lithium, anticonvulsants (e.g. carbamezapine, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, valproate) and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g. aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone)
have been used to manage manic symptoms. A combination of an
antidepressant (to stabilize depressive symptoms) and an antimanic medication (to stabilize manic symptoms) may be used concomitantly for treatment of bipolar disorder. An anti-psychotic
medication may be added if psychotic symptoms are present.

Medication Therapy for Anxiety-Related Conditions, Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD), & Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
General
a) The benzodiazepine class of medication is commonly used for anxiety
but caution should be used in prescribing since tolerance, dependence, and
serious withdrawal may occur. Use of the benzodiazepines in short-term
is usually recommended.
b) For chronic anxiety conditions (e.g. panic disorder, obsessivecompulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress,
social anxiety disorder) other agents such as SSRIs (selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors – e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram,
escitalpram), SNRIs (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors – e.g.
duloxetine, venlafaxine), buspirone, and tricyclics (clomipramine) have
been effective.
NOTES FOR MEDICATIONS IN THIS SECTION:
 1) Only common side effects are noted. Prescribers should check the medication literature for all potential side effects and
drug interactions. 2) Children, the elderly, adults with small body composition, and individuals with medical illness or
nutritional deficiencies may require smaller initial & maintenance doses for effect and may be more susceptible to side
effects. 3) Studies in the United States have indicated that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and
behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults age 18-24 with major depressive disorder (DSM IV criteria). A number
of agents are not approved in the United States for use in the pediatric population. 4) For an explanation of the abbreviations included in the tables, see the “Medical Abbreviations List” in the front of the manual. Drugs in the shaded boxes are

In communities where little or no mental health care exists, people with
mental conditions are at risk for increased illness, stigma, and abuse. Their
fundamental right to mental health and happiness can be compromised.
In Mental Health Care in Settings Where Mental Health Resources Are
Limited, author Pamela Smith MD presents a handbook for community
and hospital-based health providers who work in remote or impoverished
areas in developed and developing countries.
Designed to be used as a concise, easy-reference source, it provides an
outline of core concepts and basic interventions in mental health care.
This guide addresses conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessivecompulsive disorder, substance abuse, dementia, child and adolescent
issues, violence, and HIV/AIDS and mental health. Smith also provides
insights on the recent state of mental health care worldwide and the means
for increasing access to care in resource-limited areas.
Mental Health Care in Settings Where Mental Health Resources Are
Limited communicates how providing mental health care training to
health workers and raising awareness among other individuals within
these challenged communities serves as a signifi cant means not only to
improving access to care but also to preserving human rights and dignity.
PAMELA SMITH, MD, is an experienced psychiatrist and mental
health consultant who has coordinated and directly supervised projects
associated with the World Health Organization, UNICEF, UNHCR,
USAID, and other humanitarian aid organizations to provide mental
health training to health workers in developing countries and resourcelimited communities in the United States.

Foreword to revised edition
As expected, the first edition of the manual met with great acclaim. It fulfilled the promise of
relevance and utility to general practitioners and was eagerly sought after by many other health
professionals. There is a huge waiting list for the revised edition.
The revised edition has been extensively updated in the area of pharmacology and an entirely
new chapter on sexual dysfunction has been added. This new chapter maintains the standard
set in the previous edition—John again demonstrates his ability to condense and clarify vast
amounts of material, making it accessible and immediately useful.
Once more, I commend to you this excellent book in the expectation that it will significantly
assist you in the relief of suffering of those who seek your help.

vi A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice
Preface to revised edition
I have made a number of changes to the book, some in response to comments from readers,
others to keep the book up-to-date. The major changes are a new chapter on sexual dysfunction
and a revision of the chapter on pharmacological treatments. Over the 18 months since the
first printing, the use of thioridazine has been tightly restricted, and new antidepressants,
antipsychotics and hypnotics have become available.
The Commonwealth budget of 2001 set aside $120.4 million for the ‘Better outcomes in mental
health care’ initiative. This includes around $10 million to provide education and training to
general practitioners. Those who have undergone approved skill-based training (including two
hours of familiarisation and six hours of clinical training) will be able to apply for incentive
payments for the delivery of packages of care that include an assessment, the development of
a treatment plan and a review. Those who have undertaken 20 hours of approved skill-based
training in focused psychological strategies will gain access to higher rebates for the delivery of
six sessions of therapy, extendable to a maximum of 12 per year.
A point that needs to be made is that reading this book will not in itself necessarily translate
into improved clinical skills and the delivery of better treatment—these require participation
in a skills-based training program as well as supervision of actual clinical work. Skills-based
training programs such as the SPHERE program use modelling, role-playing and the review of
videotaped trainee interviews1
. I hope this book will be a useful resource for those undertaking
such training.
I want to express my gratitude to Anthony Bell, Simon Burton, Brian Kelly, John McGrath,
Michael Robertson, Jim Rodney and Josie Sundin for their comments on earlier drafts. Thanks
also to the Department of Health and Ageing, to Dermot Casey for his support, and to Susan
Staruszkiewicz for her patience in preparing the manuscript for print.

A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice xiii
Introduction
This book grew out of the collaboration between the Logan-Beaudesert Mental Health
Service and the Logan Area Division of General Practice on the case-conferencing project, a
series of eight seminars that aim to improve general practitioners’ knowledge of the mental
disorders that they commonly treat and to increase their familiarity with how the service
functions. I hope that it is a useful resource for similar projects.
In writing the book I have tried to combine the advantages of a manual and a textbook. I
hope that it provides easily accessible information on the assessment and treatment of the
mental disorders that general practitioners see, but in more depth than might usually be found
in a manual.
One of the challenges of treating mental health problems in general practice is that as many
as 50 per cent of them do not meet the criteria for any specific diagnosis. Moreover, people
often present with a complex combination of physical and mental health problems. I believe
that a solution to these problems is for general practitioners to develop skills in making both
a diagnosis and a formulation. While a diagnosis is made on the basis of features that the
individual shares with others who have similar problems, the formulation also includes features
specific to that individual. It brings together all of the salient factors in the person’s history
that have a bearing on the development and continuation of the problem. While the diagnosis
is a useful guide to treatment, the formulation allows treatment to be tailored to the specific
needs of the individual.
The book begins with an overview of mental health care in general practice and of the
relationship between general practitioners and district mental health services. In Chapters 2
to 13, I discuss some principles of psychiatric assessment and treatment. Since much of the
material in the rest of the book assumes an understanding of issues covered here, I recommend
reading these chapters first. In the following eleven chapters, I describe the treatment of
specific disorders. Chapter 25 deals with the issue of doctors’ own mental health. The final
chapter was written by consumers and carers of the Logan-Beaudesert Mental Health Service
as a letter to general practitioners.

Working with district mental health services
Mental disorders are prevalent in the community. They produce high levels of disability and
handicap and place a large burden on society. While specialist mental health services will never
be able to meet the demand for treatment on their own, general practitioners are well placed
to provide mental health care to the majority of those suffering a mental disorder. Indeed, most
people who seek help for their mental health problems do so from their general practitioner.
General practitioners will be assisted in this task through close collaboration with specialist
mental health services.
The burden of mental illness
In 1996 the Harvard School of Medicine, the World Bank and the World Health Organization
published their report on the Global Burden of Disease project1
. This project calculated disease
burden by adding together years of life lost through premature mortality and years lived with a
disability to form a new measure of burden, the Disability Adjusted Life Years lost (DALY). The
results were quite different from those of previous studies because of the inclusion of a measure
of disability in addition to one of mortality.
The study had salutary results with respect to the burden of mental illness. Worldwide,
mental illnesses account for 10.5 per cent of the total burden of disease. In established market
economies like Australia, they account for 22 per cent of all DALYs. The top ten conditions
worldwide include four psychiatric syndromes: unipolar depression, alcoholism, schizophrenia
and obsessive–compulsive disorder. It was calculated that by 2020 depression will be the second
highest cause of disease burden worldwide, exceeded only by ischaemic heart disease, and that
mental illness as a whole will account for 15 per cent of the total burden of disease worldwide.
The National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (1999) found that over the year of the study
more than 20 per cent of the adults surveyed suffered a mental illness2
. The commonest illnesses
were anxiety disorders (9.7 per cent), substance abuse (7.7 per cent) and affective disorders (5.8
per cent). There were differences in the prevalence of disorders between the sexes with substance
abuse more common amongst males, and anxiety and affective disorders more common amongst
females. Around one person in four suffering one mental disorder also suffered another. High
levels of disability accompany these disorders. For example, people with anxiety disorders have
an average of 2.1 days out of role every month. A disturbing finding of the survey was that only
about one-third of those suffering a mental disorder seek treatment. Most of these people seek
help from their general practitioner.
Mental health care in general practice
Around one-third of people presenting to general practitioners suffer a diagnosable mental
disorder. A further one-third suffer significant psychological symptoms that do not meet the
criteria for any specific disorder. Of those with a mental disorder, only half receive a diagnosis
and, of these, only half receive specific drug treatment3
 (see Figure 1-1). The commonest

problems are depression and anxiety, most often occurring together and frequently presenting
with physical symptoms. While these conditions often do not present with florid symptoms, they
are associated with high levels of disability and handicap. One study found that, of a group of
chronic physical illnesses, only ischaemic heart disease produced levels of disability comparable
with depression1
. The National Survey of Mental Health and Well Being confirmed the high
levels of disability associated with these disorders. Because of their high prevalence, the overall
burden of these disorders is substantial.
The assessment and treatment of people with mental health problems in general practice presents
a number of difficulties. Since the system of Medicare rebates favours short consultations, it is
often difficult to find the time to perform thorough assessments or any sort of psychotherapy.
People often present their mental health problems with physical rather than psychological
symptoms. In many cases, both mental and physical disorders are present. The cause of patients’
problems is often a complex combination of biological, psychological and social factors. The
conditions seen in general practice often do not fit neatly into established diagnostic categories,
and the effectiveness of drugs in their treatment is not always known.
General practitioners may also have difficulties working with their local mental health service.
They may be unaware of referral procedures and of the way that the mental health service
functions. They may be reluctant to refer patients because of concerns that the specialist service
will take over primary care of their mental health problems. They may feel that mental health
services have little to offer in the treatment of people with some of their most challenging
problems, such as ‘heartsink patients’ or those with personality disorders.
Hospital staff may not involve general practitioners sufficiently in discharge planning. Discharge
summaries, if they are sent, may arrive late and not readily provide the information that the
general practitioner needs to know. Mental health staff may be reluctant to discharge patients
whom they know well and whose conditions are stable because of the work involved in
arranging discharge and then getting to know a new patient. They may be unfamiliar with the
way general practitioners run their practices and uncertain of their willingness to accept referrals
for continuing care.

District mental health services
Over recent years, there have been significant changes in the way that mental health care is delivered
in Australia. The agenda for these changes was set in 1992 when the state and Commonwealth
health ministers agreed to the implementation of the National Mental Health Plan. The major
change has been the shift in the delivery of care from large stand-alone psychiatric institutions to
the community. As a consequence, families and other carers now take greater responsibility for
the support and care of people with mental illnesses. Disability support and rehabilitation services
are now provided by mainstream agencies and non-government organisations, in many cases
the same that provide services to people with physical disabilities. Ultimately, the treatment of
mental disorders should parallel that of physical conditions, with general practitioners providing
most of the ongoing care, supported by specialist mental health services.
Target population
The priority for district mental health services is to provide mental health care to people living
in their catchment area who suffer serious mental disorders and other serious mental health
problems. The target population includes people with psychotic and severe neurotic disorders, for
example, those with schizophrenia, delusional disorder, bipolar mood disorder, major depression
and severe obsessive–compulsive disorder. However, the seriousness of a disorder often has more
to do with the level of disability and handicap than with the diagnosis or level of impairment. For
example, a person with panic disorder and agoraphobia may suffer more disability and handicap
than someone with schizophrenia. It should be noted that district mental health services are not
funded to provide treatment to people whose primary problem is substance abuse, a marital or
legal problem, or intellectual disability.
The target population for district mental health services includes people with
serious mental disorders and other serious mental health problems.
General practitioners should get to know the private psychiatrists in their area, and their billing
practices. You may wish to refer a person to a private psychologist for counselling, cognitive
behavioural or behavioural treatments. Updated lists of local rehabilitation and disability support
agencies, counselling services and relevant non-government organisations should be available
from your local district mental health service or division of general practice. The following
section describes the way the Logan Beaudesert Mental Health Service functions. While most
services in Australia operate along similar lines, you will need to get to know how your local
service operates.
Referral procedures
Within office hours, you should direct referrals to the community mental health service. Most
district mental health services no longer accept outside referrals to hospital outpatients. You can
make the referral over the phone or by writing a short note.
An intake officer, a psychiatric nurse or allied health professional who has been trained in mental
health assessment, will accept the referral. Since it is not a medical officer who performs the first
assessment, the referral letter should be addressed to the intake officer, not the doctor.
Referral letters to district mental health services should be addressed to the
intake officer.
All referrals are discussed the following weekday in a multi-disciplinary staff meeting when the
final decision about the person’s treatment plan is made. If the service accepts the person for
ongoing treatment, he or she is assigned a medical officer (psychiatrist or psychiatric registrar)
4
and, usually, a case-manager.
People needing urgent assessment out-of-hours are generally seen in the hospital emergency
department. However, most services have some form of extended hours service (see below).
The role of the case-manager
The case-manager (sometimes called key worker) is a mental health nurse or allied health
professional (psychologist, social worker or occupational therapist) whose principal role is to
coordinate the different aspects of a person’s care. This often involves linking the person with
a range of accommodation, social security, disability support and rehabilitation agencies. The
case manager is also responsible for monitoring patients’ mental states, their clinic attendance,
and their adherence to medication and follow-up—and for supporting their families and other
carers. The case-manager is the person you should contact when you require information about
a current client of a district mental health service.
Recent developments
The mobile intensive treatment team
Over the past five years, a number of services have been evaluating the role of mobile intensive
treatment teams. These comprise a specialised group of staff who provide intensive case
management to a small group of the most disabled consumers. Caseloads are kept small in order
to permit high levels of care. The evaluation of this mode of service delivery has presented some
methodological difficulties, but preliminary results suggest that mobile intensive treatment teams
reduce hospital bed-days, produce high levels of consumer and carer satisfaction, and lead to
better patient outcomes in terms of reduced impairment, disability and handicap.
The extended hours service
The National Standards for Mental Health Services include the provision of services 24-hours
a day. Most services throughout Australia now have at least some limited after-hours capacity.
For example, the Logan-Beaudesert Mental Health Service has an extended hours service
that provides assessment and ongoing case management between 5pm and 9pm on weekday
evenings, and between 10am and 6pm on weekends and public holidays. At other times, a
phone advisory service is provided and assessments are available through the Logan Hospital
Emergency Department.
Community Assessment and Treatment teams
In some states, Community Assessment and Treatment (CAT) teams have been established
that provide assessments, intensive treatment and support, often in the person’s home. In some
services they act as gatekeepers to the inpatient units and also have access to alternatives to
hospital accommodation such as motels or home care.
Partnerships in mental health care
The establishment of effective working partnerships between general practitioners and mental
health services is one of the key aims of the second National Mental Health Plan, released in July
1998. The advantages of providing mental health care in general practice are clear. It normalises
mental health treatment, putting it on a par with the treatment of physical illness. There is less
stigma attached to attending a general practitioner than attending a specialist mental health
service. Patients can have both their physical and mental health needs met by the same person.
Improving mental health care in general practice will help address the large unmet need for the
treatment of the high prevalence depressive, anxiety and somatoform disorders. The ability of
general practitioners to treat most of the mental health problems that they see will allow the
specialist mental health services to concentrate on treating people with more severe disorders.
General practitioners will gain greater job satisfaction if they are able to more effectively diagnose

and treat the large number of their patients who suffer mental health problems.
In March 1999, three million dollars was set aside from the budget of the Second National
Mental Health Plan for a national initiative in primary mental health care, the aims of which are
to provide education and support to general practitioners in mental health care, and to promote
partnerships between general practitioners and public and private mental health services. Some
of the strategies used to meet these goals include the development of educational packages on
the treatment of the sorts of mental illness commonly seen by general practitioners, and programs
aimed at familiarising general practitioners with the way mental health services function. A
number of models of cooperation between general practitioners and mental health services have
been developed. The essential prerequisite is effective communication—between generalist and
specialist, private and public systems, and between medical and non-medical practitioners. The
divisions of general practice are ideally placed to coordinate these partnerships with district
mental health services*
.
Since November 1999 new Medicare Schedule items have been available for general practitioners
to bill for care planning and case conferencing with other health professionals, without the
patient being present. Items are available for the preparation and review of care plans for patients
who have one or more chronic conditions with complex multidisciplinary care needs. The plan
may be made on discharge from an inpatient facility or during community care. It requires
informed consent from the patient. It must be documented and include jointly formulated
management goals that the patient and carer agree to. It must involve the general practitioner
together with two other health care providers from different clinical disciplines who are involved
in the person’s ongoing care and agree to work with the general practitioner to achieve the set
goals. Additional items are available for case conferences. These also require the involvement of
at least two other health care providers involved in the ongoing care of a person with one or
more chronic conditions and complex multidisciplinary care needs. Documentation includes a
list of participants, times, problems, goals, strategies discussed and a summary of outcomes. Prior
consent must be obtained. The patient and the other health care providers are given a copy of
the summary.
The ‘Better outcomes in mental health care’ initiative announced in the 2001 Commonwealth
Budget has five major components: incentive payments for general practitioners to provide
assessment, care planning and review of people with mental health problems; education and
training of general practitioners; new Medicare Benefits Schedule items for focused psychological
strategies provided by appropriately trained general practitioners; access to allied health services
through funds held by divisions of general practice; and improved access to psychiatrists through
a new Medicare Benefit Schedule item for psychiatrist case conferencing involving the general
practitioner, a psychiatrist and one other professional with or without the patient, and provision
for consultation between the general practitioner and a psychiatrist in emergency situations.
The ‘beyondblue’ initiative is a $35 million commitment over five years from state, territory and
federal governments, lead by Victoria and the Commonwealth, to optimise the care of people
with depression and related disorders1
. The five priority areas are the promotion of community
awareness and literacy, consumer and carer input, prevention and early intervention, applied
research, and primary care training and support. The latter includes projects to improve the
delivery and quality care for depression in general practice.

An example of collaboration between general practitioners and
a district mental health service
The Logan Area Division of General Practice provides support to general practitioners working
in an area situated about halfway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The Logan Beaudesert
Mental Health Service provides mental health care to residents in the Logan Beaudesert Health
District, which includes the area covered by the Division, but also extends south, around the
western boundary of the Gold Coast District, to the New South Wales border.
The Division and the Service have collaborated on a number of projects over the past six years.
The case-conferencing project comprises eight two-hour sessions in which general practitioners
meet with two psychiatrists from the Service. In the first hour, there is discussion on a focus
topic taken from this book. In the second hour, a psychiatrist interviews a patient of one of the
general practitioners in front of the group. A discussion of issues raised by the case then follows.
The project has succeeded in increasing general practitioners knowledge of the sorts of mental
health problems that they commonly see and their familiarity with the Service1
.
The case-conferencing project and the SPHERE program aim to improve the
skills of general practitioners in treating the mental health problems that they
commonly see.
General practitioners in the Division have also undergone training in the SPHERE program,
which takes its name from the Somatic and Psychological Health Report (SPHERE), a selfreport instrument developed for the detection of psychological problems in general practice
populations2
. The program comprises four components: a case-identification system for
psychological disorders; a four-seminar training program for the management of depression and
anxiety by general practitioners; a 12-month disease management program for use by general
practitioners; and ongoing doctor support through the provision of clinical and educational
materials and further educational activities. More extended programs are being developed to
cover cognitive behavioural therapy, chronic fatigue and chronic pain, geriatric depression and
adolescent mental health problems.
The Logan Area Division of General Practice has recently been chosen to be one of the
metropolitan sites for the General Practice and Psychiatrists Partnership program (GPAPP),
an initiative coordinated by the Queensland Divisions of General Practice (QDGP) and
funded by the National Mental Health Strategy through Queensland Health. It is based on the
Consultation-Liaison in Primary Care Psychiatry Project (CLIPP), which was pioneered in
Melbourne3
. Psychiatrists from the District Mental Health Service visit group practices once a
fortnight to provide on-site consultation on the management of difficult cases. In Melbourne,
the project has facilitated the transfer of patients’ care from district mental health services back
to primary care.

The metropolitan pilot of the GPAPP program aims to provide on-site
consultations to general practitioners on the treatment of people with mental
disorders.
Over the past year, the Division and the Service have collaborated on the shared care project.
This involves a case manager from the Service working with a group of general practitioners
who have completed the case-conferencing project in the management of around twenty people
with schizophrenia. The general practitioners meet with a psychiatrist once a month to review
patient care and for ongoing education. Preliminary results show high levels of satisfaction
amongst all participants. There were no significant changes in mental health outcome, though
an unexpected result was a reduction in occupied bed days in hospital. A number of physical
disorders were diagnosed and treated. The project has subsequently been extended to include 20
general practitioners in the Division and all case managers of the Service.
These projects constitute changes in the culture of mental health service delivery towards greater
cooperation between public and private sectors and specifically between mental health services
and general practitioners. The aims are improved patient outcomes, more efficient service
delivery and a lessening of psychiatric morbidity in the community.
The aim of educational and shared care projects is to improve health outcomes
in the population by changing the culture of mental health care delivery
towards greater cooperation between the public and private sectors.

Mental health assessments
This chapter begins with a discussion of eight principles of the psychiatric interview. An outline
of the psychiatric history and mental state examination follows. In the final section, I discuss the
differences between a diagnosis and a formulation and provide several sample formulations.
Eight principles of the psychiatric interview
1. Time
Psychiatric assessment and psychological treatments take time. Spending time listening to and
clarifying patients’ problems, and making an attempt to understand how they feel and why they
feel that way, is therapeutic in itself. Unfortunately, the pressure of work in general practice makes
it difficult to find this time. Moreover, the financial incentives of Medicare are towards shorter,
not longer, consultations. One solution is to spread the assessment out over several sessions.
The use of self-report questionnaires such as the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)1 or the
SPHERE-GP instrument will also save time in the consultation2 (see also Appendix 1).
The use of self-report questionnaires, such as the SPHERE-GP, can save time in
the consultation.
2. Reassurance
As a rule, it is better to try to understand a person’s experience more clearly than to give bland
reassurance. Although you may mean well, he or she may perceive a reassuring comment as
presumptuous or rejecting. However, reassurance does have a place when it is true and does not
dismiss the person’s experience. It may then instil hope. Some examples are given in Box 2-1.
3. Interview technique
The following characteristics of interview style improve the likelihood of detecting mental
illness:
Chapter 2
Box 2-1: Reassurance
Unhelpful comments:
‘I’m sure things can’t be as bad as you say.’
‘But there is no reason for you to feel that way.’
‘I understand how you feel, but….’
Helpful comment:
(To a depressed man) ‘When people are depressed, they often feel that nothing can be done to help.
There are effective treatments for depression and I know that I can help you.’

•	 listening, clarifying and asking for an example
•	 not interrupting, especially at the beginning of the interview
•	 asking open-ended questions, especially at the beginning of the interview
•	 asking directive psychological questions
•	 an empathic style – This involves putting yourself in the other person’s position so as to
understand how he or she feels, thinks and behaves, and why he or she feels that way.
However, empathy is not simply an uncritical acceptance of a person’s ideas and impulses
(see the note on pseudoempathy in Box 12-3).
•	 picking up and responding to verbal and non-verbal cues
•	 maintaining control of the interview.
Examples are given in Box 2-2.
4. Transference and countertransference
Transference can be broadly defined as the feelings that the patient has for you. Some of these
Box 2-2: Examples of effective interview techniques
Clarification
You ask a man to give you an example of what he means when he says he has suffered a panic
attack.
You summarise the person’s complaints, their time course and the events happening at the time.
Asking open-ended questions
At the beginning of the interview, you ask, ‘How are you feeling?’
Directive psychological questions
You ask a man who presents with fatigue and insomnia if he has been feeling down or depressed. Later,
you ask him about anhedonia, vegetative function change and suicidality.
Response to a verbal cue
A 47-year-old man complains of a number of vague physical symptoms including fatigue, abdominal
discomfort and headaches. He says that he cannot even be bothered playing indoor cricket any more.
You ask, ‘When did you last do something that you really did enjoy?’ He takes some time responding,
and then says, ‘It seems ages. I suppose I enjoyed the trip to Caloundra last Christmas’. Then you ask if
he has been feeling depressed. You pick up the man’s cue about anhedonia and follow it up with direct
questions about depression.
Response to a non-verbal cue
A woman who has been attending your practice over the past five years is not herself. She looks tired
and depressed and sits slumped in the chair. Usually well groomed, today her hair is untidy and her
clothes rumpled. Her affect is flat and she speaks in a soft voice giving unelaborated responses to your
questions. You say, ‘ You look tired today. How are you feeling?’ Later you ask if she has been feeling
depressed.
Empathic style
A middle-aged man becomes depressed after being overlooked for a promotion at work. You ask about
his prospects for promotion in the future. This uncovers his fear that, at 52, he is unlikely ever to be
promoted. The question that you ask leads the man to elaborate his concerns. Further questions may
address the other developmental challenges of middle age that he is presently facing.
Maintaining control
An elderly man speaks at length about how unjustly he is treated by his neighbours. You say, ‘I am sorry
to hear that you are so upset by your neighbours, but could I take you back to what you were saying
about feeling depressed’.
Mental health assessments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 11
feelings are reality-based, for example, respect for your expertise in medicine. Others have
unconscious origins and arise from the transference on to you of feelings that are held towards
others who are significant in the person’s past or present. For example, being perceived by a
young man as an authority figure, you may elicit transference feelings that he has towards his
parents, teachers and other authority figures in his life.
Countertransference refers to the feelings that you have towards the patient. Again, these will,
in part, be reality-based. Some will arise in response to the transference. Some will be similar
to feelings that are elicited in other people who deal with that person, while others will reflect
aspects of your own past and present relationships transferred on to the patient. Most will be a
combination of all of these. It is normal, of course, that you should experience these feelings.
The important thing is to be aware of them and to acknowledge them to yourself, even if
they seem unacceptable—for example, feeling angry or bored with a person, feeling overly
concerned about or even feeling attracted to him or her. By acknowledging these feelings to
yourself and making them conscious you are much less likely to act inappropriately upon them.
For example, it is quite normal to feel angry with certain people, but it is likely to be damaging
and unprofessional to act out this anger.
By acknowledging to yourself your countertransference responses, you lessen
the likelihood of acting out upon them.
Monitoring your countertransference responses can provide you with valuable information
about a person. For example, when seeing a young woman who repeatedly self-harms, you
may feel frustrated and angry and you may even imagine being cruel to her. Recognising
these feelings and impulses, you take care not to act out upon them. Reflecting upon them,
you recognise their origin in the physical and sexual abuse that she suffered at the hands of her
foster father. You gain a deeper understanding of her and the way people react towards her. By
containing the impulse to act out, you avoid repeating and reinforcing the abusive patterns of
her previous relationships. At the same time, you take care not to act upon unrealistic fantasies
of ‘rescuing’ her (see also Chapter 22).
Monitoring the countertransference can improve your understanding of the
patient.
5. Boundary issues
Doctors are sanctioned to ask about private and intimate aspects of their patients’ lives and to
conduct physical examinations. There is a clear power differential in the relationship between
patient and doctor. In particular, people presenting for counselling or any type of psychological
therapy are often at their most vulnerable. The transference of flattering feelings and impulses
onto the doctor—respect for authority, attraction to power and success, desire for approval—
may tempt the doctor into abusing his or her power. To exploit such a position to fulfil ones own
needs is unethical and potentially damaging to patients.
It is essential to be clear about your role as a professional. You are not a friend of the patient.
Indeed, it is wise to avoid, if possible, treating your friends. It is always unethical to have sexual
relations with a patient. For professional therapists, it is prohibited to have intimate relations even
after therapy has finished.
Monitor your countertransference feelings and impulses and take care not to act out in ways
that breach professional boundaries. Transgressions of these boundaries typically occur in a
stepwise progression. They may begin with the acceptance of expensive gifts, financial or stockbroking advice, or even betting tips. There may be a temptation to disclose and discuss one’s
own problems. Appointments may be made that are longer than usual, or regularly scheduled
12
at the end of the day when other staff members have left the practice. Fees may be waived.
Unnecessary home visits may be made. This may progress to the performance of unnecessary
physical examinations, meeting patients outside the consulting room, and to involvement in
social situations and sexual relations.
Doctors who are vulnerable to boundary transgressions include those experiencing life crises, in
particular those with problems in their own marriages or personal relationships1
. Perfectionists
who are excessively self-sacrificing and work unnecessarily long hours may have difficulty setting
limits on the demands of certain patients and begin taking extraordinary measures in attempt
to rescue them. Patients with histories of sexual abuse may be particularly prone to evoke such
countertransference responses, especially when they express recurrent suicidal ideation. Doctors
who deny their dependency needs and give the appearance of being self-contained may be
prone to seeking gratification for their needs for love and nurturance through their patients:
while denying their own dependency needs, they may perceive others as being dependent on
and needy of them. A doctor suffering a psychosis might violate professional boundaries as a
consquence of the illness. Psychopathic doctors who wilfully exploit patients for the gratification
of their own needs have no place in the medical profession.
Boundary transgressions typically occur in a stepwise progression.
6. Understanding versus explanation
In formulating a person’s problems, we seek to answer the question, ‘Why does this individual
feel, think and act this way at this time?’ The method of understanding helps us find reasons for
his or her experience; the method of explanation seeks causes.
We understand a person’s experience when, through listening to his or her story and clarifying
the experience, we are able to empathise with him or her and to imagine how we might
feel under similar circumstances. We can understand experiences in the mind of another. For
example, we understand the grief of the bereaved, the anger of someone who is frustrated, the
guilt of the person who has hurt another and the shame of someone who has done something
foolish. We can also understand the meaning of an event for that person, and we can look for
reasons why he or she feels that way.
We can understand the grief of the bereaved, the anger of someone who has
been frustrated, the guilt of the person who has hurt someone else, and the
shame of someone who has done something foolish.
By contrast, aspects of some mental states are not understandable in this way. For example,
there is no understandable reason for the memory loss of someone with dementia. We cannot
empathise with changes in another person’s brain. Instead, we seek an explanation in terms of a
cause—in this case, a disruption in brain physiology and a loss of brain substance. Similarly, we
cannot understand how a person with schizophrenia starts hearing voices. There is no meaningful
reason for this reaction and we cannot empathise with it. Instead, we seek explanations in terms
of neurotransmitters, abnormalities in information processing and other physical causes.

Misconduct, Eds Bloom JD, Nadelson CC, Notman MT. Washington DC, American Psychiatric Press,

Mental health assessments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 13
The memory loss of someone with dementia or the hallucinations of someone
with schizophrenia are not understandable. There is no reason for them.
Instead, they require an explanation—a cause.
An understandable reaction is not necessarily a normal one. For example, you might understand
why a high-achieving man becomes depressed following a myocardial infarction. However, this
should not stop you from diagnosing major depression if his depressed mood persists and he
expresses feelings of worthlessness and guilt, and suicidal ideation. While the understandable
aspects of a condition may be amenable to some form of psychotherapy, the condition may also
require some pharmacological intervention or even ECT.
Although a problem may be understandable, its treatment may require
pharmacological or other physical interventions.
Since all mental disorder is both a disorder of mind and of the brain, it is always possible to
both understand and explain different aspects of the same problem. The grief of a bereaved
woman will be reflected in biochemical and other events in her brain. However, the fact that
her reaction is clearly understandable indicates that our initial treatment would be through grief
counselling. If her grief is prolonged, and she begins to suffer prominent and distressing feelings
of guilt, and is contemplating suicide, we would use an anti-depressant drug as an adjunct to the
grief work. Similarly, in the case of a man with schizophrenia, although we may not be able to
understand the evolution of his auditory hallucinations (the form of his experience), we may be
able to empathise with their content. We can also empathise with his reactions to the disability
and handicap that he suffers as a consequence of the illness. For the person with dementia, the
feelings of loss, fears about the future, and the change to a more dependent role are all issues that
are understandable and amenable to psychotherapy and counselling.
While the form of a delusion proper is not understandable, it is often possible
to empathise with its content.
7. The dialectical principle
In the philosophy of Hegel, dialectics is a process in which a proposition is made (thesis), then
negated (antithesis), and finally replaced by a new proposition that resolves the conflict between
the two (synthesis)1
. Although this may seem a little obscure, this way of thinking is common in
making decisions about mental health problems. You will often have to make choices between
apparently contradictory propositions. Always consider the possibility that the best course of
action lies in a synthesis of the two. There are very few propositions in psychiatry that hold true
in every case. Some examples of these dialectical dilemmas are given in Box 2-3.
In psychiatry, the best solution to a problem is often a synthesis of two
apparently contradictory possibilities.
8. Impairment, disability and handicap
When assessing people with mental health problems, it is useful to classify their complaints
as impairments, disabilities or handicaps. Mental impairment is any loss or abnormality in
psychological functioning. It includes the signs and symptoms of mental illness. Disability is any
restriction or lack in ability to perform an activity normal for a human being. Handicap is a
disadvantage, resulting from impairment or disability, that limits or prevents the fulfilment of a
1
 Brown L, Ed. The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993.
14
social role that is normal for that individual, given his or her age, sex and cultural expectations.
It is helpful to make this distinction when planning management. In general, the alleviation of
impairments is the focus of treatment, while the prevention and minimisation of disabilities and
handicaps constitutes disability support and rehabilitation. As a general practitioner, you will
mainly be involved in the delivery of treatment. However, you need to be familiar with the
rehabilitation services in your area, to know the appropriate referral procedures and to be able
to work in partnership with them. Some examples of impairment, disability and handicap are
shown in Box 2-4.
Box 2-3: Some dialectical dilemmas
Since she has a terminal illness, it is understandable that she is depressed, so I should not prescribe medication.
Wrong: although her depression is understandable, if her symptoms persist and include feelings
of worthlessness and guilt, suicidality or psychotic symptoms, she should be treated with an
antidepressant (and possibly an antipsychotic or ECT) in addition to some form of psychotherapy to
deal with her grief.
Should I make a formulation specific to this woman’s problems or should I make a diagnosis and treat the
condition from which she suffers? Do both.
Is substance abuse or an underlying psychosis causing his psychotic symptoms? It could be a combination of
the two.
Are his cognitive deficits due to dementia or major depression? A third possibility is that he suffers both
conditions.
Her panic attacks are probably just secondary to her depression so if I treat the depression they should
also improve. Isolated panic attacks can occur in major depression, but if they are recurrent and
accompanied by persistent concern about having more attacks, worry about the implications of the
attacks, or significant behaviour change, then both diagnoses should be made. In general practice
settings, mixed anxiety/depression is more common that either one alone. Treat both.
I should strive to be decisive and make the final diagnosis in the first session. Make a working diagnosis
in the first session, but be prepared to tolerate some uncertainty about the final diagnosis. The
formulation will continue to evolve and deepen so long as you continue to see the person.
I must never breach a patient’s confidentiality. There are exceptions. For example, if the person makes
a direct threat against someone else, you may be obliged to contact the police or to warn the
intended victim. With most mental health treatment now being delivered in the community, a larger
responsibility for care now falls on the family or other carers. Unless expressly forbidden to do so by
the individual, carers should, whenever possible, be involved in treatment. Ask the person if you can
meet his or her spouse and family at the next consultation.
Note: Like the other propositions in psychiatry, the dialectical principle itself does not always apply.
For example:
During an exacerbation of his psychosis, a man with schizophrenia develops obsessive–compulsive symptoms.
Should I diagnose obsessive–compulsive disorder? Here, the hierarchical principle of diagnosis applies. The
neurotic symptoms are subsumed under the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.
An elderly woman becomes delirious post-operatively and experiences hallucinations and persecutory delusions.
Should an additional diagnosis of schizophrenia be made? No. Organic disorders stand at the top of the
diagnostic hierarchy and may be manifest by any neurotic or psychotic symptoms.
A Vietnam veteran presents with a number of anxiety and depressive symptoms in addition to re-experiencing
a traumatic battle scene. Should I diagnose depression, generalised anxiety and agoraphobia? The most
parsimonious explanation is post-traumatic stress disorder, though this disorder may be complicated
by major depression or an anxiety disorder.
Mental health assessments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 15
General practitioners treat patients’ impairments and coordinate their
rehabilitation to minimise disability and handicap.
The psychiatric assessment
The aim of the assessment is to answer the following questions, ‘How is this person feeling,
thinking and acting at this time? How did he or she come to be this way? What resources are
available that will assist treatment? What are the potential barriers to treatment?’
What follows is a comprehensive description of the history and mental state examination. The
weight placed on the different parts of the assessment will vary from individual to individual.
For example, the past medical history of a 60-year-old man presenting for the first time with
depression is a vital part of the assessment, while in the case of a fit young man presenting with
an adjustment disorder it is much less likely to contribute to the formulation. Similarly, the
assessment of cognitive functioning is essential in the assessment of someone with dementia, but
will not usually be a significant factor in assessing a young man presenting with depression. The
sort of therapy that you will be using will also influence the nature of the assessment. For example,
if you are offering cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT), you will seek information about the
person’s automatic thoughts (see Chapter 10). If you use interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), you
will need to take an interpersonal inventory (see Chapter 1). The presenting complaint and the
mental state examination are the most important parts of the assessment.
General practitioners will rarely have time to take a detailed history in a single consultation.
However, they often have the advantage of already knowing much of their patients’ personal
and family histories, and of being familiar with their normal mental states. In some cases, it
may be necessary to spread the assessment out over two or more sessions with the first session
concentrating on the presenting complaint and a risk assessment. Whenever possible, families
and other carers should be involved in the assessment and treatment from the outset. Time may
be saved by using the SPHERE-GP1
, a self-report screening instrument that identifies people
with psychological distress who need a thorough diagnostic assessment (see Appendix 1).
The presenting complaint and mental state examination are the most
important parts of the psychiatric assessment.
Box 2-4: Examples of impairment, disability and handicap
• A woman with schizophrenia hears her thoughts spoken out loud (thought broadcast, an
impairment). As a consequence, she withdraws, spending much of her time at home, and she no
longer goes shopping (agoraphobia, a disability). She has not managed to work since the onset
of her illness five years before, she has no social contacts outside her immediate family and she
depends on her husband to do all of her shopping (handicap).
• A man has developed agoraphobia (disability) after having a panic attack (impairment) in a bank
three months before. He remains on sickness allowance and sees little of his friends. His wife is
becoming increasingly exasperated by his dependence on her (handicap).
• A man with early dementia suffers memory deficits, disorientation in place and mild agnosia
(impairments). He has left the gas on twice after heating the kettle, he got lost on the way back
from the shops and his wife has to remind him to attend to his personal hygiene (disabilities). He
had to give up his job as an architect a year ago and is now becoming increasingly dependent on
his wife for care and supervision (handicap).

Psychiatric history
Identification data
Most of the person’s identification data is probably obtained when he or she registers to see you.
As well as name, age and address, it is also useful to know whom patients live with, the type of
accommodation they occupy, their occupational status and their means of support. In discussing
a patient with a colleague, it is useful to state these facts at the outset.
The presenting complaint
The presenting complaint and the mental state examination are the most important parts of the
assessment. A list of the steps taken when eliciting the presenting complaint and some useful
questions are shown in Box 2-5.
Assessment of suicidality and dangerousness
Any person presenting with psychiatric symptoms should be asked about suicidality and
dangerousness. However, you should be ready to use the structured problem solving techniques
described in Chapter 6 to help find alternative ways of dealing with life stressors if the person
does suffer suicidal ideation. You should also seek an agreement that if the suicidal ideas recur,
he or she will seek help before acting upon them. See Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion of
these issues.
Past psychiatric history
Details of a person’s past psychiatric history should be sought:
• time and nature of the first presentation
• past and current treatments and their effectiveness
Box 2-5: The presenting complaint
1. Listen and list the complaints. ‘What are the problems?’
2. Clarify the complaints. ‘What was running through your mind at the time? What were you afraid
might happen? How did that make you feel? What did you do then?’
3. Clarify the time course and any precipitants. ‘When did you last feel well—your usual self? What
was happening around that time?’
4. Summarise. ‘Am I right to say that you have been feeling down in the dumps, tired and on edge
for the past six months, and that last week you got so frightened in the cinema that you thought
were going to die and you had to leave immediately and go home?’
5. Ask about other symptoms. For example, assess anhedonia in a depressed person by asking, ‘What
do you like doing? When did you last do something you really enjoyed? Do you like watching
TV?’ Assess suicidality by asking, ‘Do you ever feel life is not worth living? Have you ever had
thoughts of ending your life?’
6. Assess the level of disability and handicap by asking about their work, hobbies, interests and how
they spend their time; and about the quality of their personal relationships. ‘How are you coping
at work? How are things at home? Are you still seeing your friends?’
7. Investigate the social context. ‘How is this affecting the other members of the family? How are
your children getting on at school? How does your wife respond to your problems? How are
you getting on with her? Can I speak to her about it?’ Obtain collateral history from the person’s
carers, family or other acquaintances. This is especially important if the person has a severe acute
mental disorder that prevents him or her from giving a full and reliable history.
8. Ask about the effectiveness of previous treatments. ‘Have you ever felt this way before? What did
you do about it? What helped?’
Mental health assessments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 17
• names of previous therapists
• past admissions – number, length, place and treatment, especially the first and the most
recent admission.
Past medical history
The relationship between physical and mental illness is discussed in greater detail in Chapters 16
to 19. Physical illnesses can cause mental illness, (e.g. hypothyroidism complicated by depression)
or precipitate mental illness (e.g. depression in response to suffering a myocardial infarction).
In general practice, people with mental illnesses commonly present with physical symptoms.
Mental illness can lead to an exacerbation of concurrent medical conditions, (e.g. a man with
schizophrenia who fails to adhere to his diabetic treatment). When both mental and physical
disorders are present, the prognosis for both conditions is worse. The presence of a physical
illness may influence your choice of medication.
Current medication
Record drug names and doses for both physical and mental illnesses. Are there any that might
be affecting the person’s mental state? Are there potential interactions with the drugs used to
treat the mental disorder?
Alcohol and other substance abuse (see also Chapter 18)
Document the following:
• the amount consumed and the period and pattern of abuse
• tolerance – increasing amounts required to achieve the same effect
• withdrawal symptoms
• unsuccessful efforts to cut down
• the salience of the abuse – large amounts of time spent obtaining, using or recovering from
the effects of the substance
• complications – physical (e.g. liver disease, peptic ulcer in the person with alcohol abuse),
psychological (e.g. cocaine-induced depression)
• disability and handicap – loss of job, legal (e.g. driving under the influence), social (e.g.
neglect of children, marital breakdown).
Forensic history
Note any serious offences, especially those leading to imprisonment. Is there a history of violence
towards others? Is the person facing any current charges?
Family psychiatric history
Document the family tree and note any relatives with mental illness. Ask about the person’s
relationships with other family members—these often have a strong influence on the quality of
his or her current close relationships. Ask about the reactions of family members to the person’s
problems and the level of support that they provide. Ask if you can meet the person’s family or
other carers to discuss the problems with them and to involve them in treatment.
Ask if you can speak to the person’s spouse, family or other carers in order to
gain collateral information and to involve them in treatment.
18
Personal history
As the person’s general practitioner, you may already know much of his or her personal
history:
• circumstances of birth
• developmental milestones
• relationship with parents and siblings
• schooling
• childhood neglect, abuse or trauma
• work history
• marital/relationship history
• current interests.
Schooling, work history and the quality of a person’s relationships are important guides to the
stability of his or her personality. For example, the fact that a woman has been happily married
for 15 years and has been content and settled in the same job for the past 10 years suggests
that she has a strong and stable personality. These are important protecting factors that indicate
a good prognosis. The precipitants of current problems may have significance in terms of a
person’s developmental history Box 2-6.
Pre-morbid personality
A person’s pre-morbid personality may predispose to the development of mental disorder. For
example, a person with dependent traits may be vulnerable to depression following a separation.
Be careful not to confuse a person’s current mental state with his or her normal way of behaving.
For example, during a manic episode, a man may appear ‘histrionic’, but this may be quite unlike
his normal personality.
Schooling, work history and the pattern of a person’s relationships are
important guides to the stability of his or her personality.
See Chapter 12 for a discussion of the following core psychodynamic issues. Their assessment
will often enhance the formulation.
1. impulse control
2. self-esteem
3. shame and guilt
4. quality of relationships
5. defence mechanisms
6. developmental challenges
Box 2-6: The meaning of precipitating events
A woman becomes depressed around the time of her daughter’s seventh birthday. On taking the
personal history, you discover that her own mother died shortly after she turned seven.
Mental health assessments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 19
Mental state examination
Appearance – Observe the person’s self-care, grooming, general physical health and dress. For
example, a man who is depressed may neglect his self-care. A person with schizophrenia may
dress bizarrely. A person with obsessive–compulsive personality traits may dress with excessive
conformity, while one with histrionic traits may dress flamboyantly.
Behaviour – Note how the person acts during the interview. A depressed person may exhibit
psychomotor agitation or retardation. An anxious person may sweat, have a tremor and startle
easily. A person on antipsychotic medication may have akathisia or exhibit Parkinsonian
side effects. People with depression, schizophrenia or organic psychoses may exhibit signs of
catatonia.
Conversation – Document the volume and rate of speech, and the command of grammar and
vocabulary. A person with negative symptoms of schizophrenia may exhibit a poverty of speech
or a lack of spontaneous speech. A depressed person may be electively mute. A person suffering
mania may exhibit pressure of speech. A person with intellectual disability may mispronounce
words, have limited vocabulary and make grammatical errors. A person who has suffered a
cerebro-vascular accident may be dysphasic.
Mood/affect – Mood refers to the sustained emotional tone that is reported by the individual.
Some words commonly used to describe mood include euthymic, depressed, angry, elated,
elevated, irritable or anxious. Affect refers to the varying emotional response witnessed during
the interview. Some terms used to describe this include appropriate, inappropriate, fatuous,
blunted, restricted, flat or labile.
Perception – Patients may suffer hallucinations. Those with schizophrenia may experience
hallucinations in any sensory modality (i.e. visual, gustatory, olfactory, kinaesthetic or auditory).
However, auditory hallucinations are the most common. In delusional disorder, there may be
kinaesthetic or olfactory hallucinations related to the delusional theme. In organic psychoses,
hallucinations may occur in any sensory modality. Illusions are most often experienced by
persons who are intoxicated or delirious.
The most common perceptual abnormalities in schizophrenia are auditory
hallucinations.
Thought disorder
a) Thought form – People with schizophrenia may show evidence of formal thought disorder
ranging from mild loosening of associations to incoherence. They may also exhibit concrete
thinking—that is, having only a literal understanding of language without an appreciation of
the abstract meanings conveyed, for example, through metaphor and humour.
b) Thought content – Delusions are features of psychotic illnesses. They may be persecutory,
grandiose, nihilistic, bizarre, etc. People with neurotic disorders such as hypochondriasis
may have overvalued ideas. Those with anxiety disorders may suffer phobias, obsessions or
compulsions.
c) Thought possession – A person with schizophrenia may experience thought insertion,
thought withdrawal, thought broadcast or thought block. She or he may also experience
other passivity phenomena (i.e. somatic passivity or passivity of emotion, impulse or volition).
See Chapter 22 for a more detailed discussion of these phenomena.
d) Thought stream – A person with mania may exhibit flight of ideas. Someone with depression
may be psychomotor retarded. The thinking of people with organic disorders or certain
personality disorders may be circumstantial.
20
Cognition – In an acute brain syndrome (delirium) the onset is usually rapid, and the level
of consciousness, orientation, concentration and attention span, as well as memory and other
areas of cognitive function are impaired. Delirium frequently presents with a variety of other
abnormalities on the mental state examination, including perceptual abnormalities (e.g.
hallucinations and illusions) and delusions.
A rapid onset of symptoms that include an altered level of consciousness,
disorientation, and impaired attention and concentration suggests a diagnosis
of delirium.
People with chronic brain syndromes, such as dementia, usually suffer an insidious onset of the
illness. They are usually alert, (i.e. have a normal level of consciousness) and sometimes oriented
with normal attention, but have deficits in memory, especially short-term memory, and in other
areas of cognitive function—abstraction, judgment, and higher cortical functioning. They may
also undergo a change in personality (see Chapter 17).
People with severe functional disorders, such as major depression, may exhibit pseudodementia—
that is, despite having normal cognitive capacity, they perform poorly on tests of cognitive
function because of the severity of their mental disorder.
The principal components of the assessment of cognitive function are listed below. A useful
screening test is the mini-mental status examination (see Appendix 2).
a) Level of consciousness – This ranges from alert through clouded to comatose.
b) Orientation – Test orientation in person, place and time.
c) Attention – This may be tested using serial 7s, serial 3s, by spelling ‘world’ backwards or by
asking the person to recite the months of the year backwards.
d) Memory – Any person with dementia will have some degree of amnesia. Confabulation is a
feature of Korsakoff’s psychosis, but can occur in any disorder in which memory is impaired.
Test immediate recall by asking the person to repeat a name and address or three objects.
Short-term memory can be tested by recall of the name and address (or the objects) after
five minutes. You can usually test long-term memory during the clinical interview. You can
test it formally by asking questions about past world events.
e) Other tests – General knowledge can be tested by asking about current world events.
Remember to take into account a person’s education and cultural background when selecting
suitable questions. Tests of abstract thinking include asking the person the interpretation of
a proverb, or asking differences (e.g. between ice and glass, or between a dwarf and a child).
Judgement—the ability of a person to make rational plans of action—is usually assessed
while taking the history, but can be tested formally by asking what the person would do if
she or he found a stamped, addressed envelope.
f) Intelligence – The assessment of a person’s current functioning in the light of his or
her educational and occupational background is required in the diagnosis of dementia.
Neuropsychological assessment provides more detailed information. A high IQ is sometimes
a protecting factor for someone with a mental disorder, but on the other hand, intelligent
people may be acutely aware of losses they suffer as a consequence of illness.
Insight – Insight refers to the ability of a person to understand his or her problems, their
origin and what can be done to overcome them. It is rarely an all-or-none phenomenon. For
example, a man with schizophrenia may deny that he has the illness and still believe in the reality
of his delusions, yet at the same time regularly attend appointments and adhere to prescribed
medication. What is important for the person to understand depends on the condition from
which he or she suffers and the treatments available. For a person with a psychotic illness, an
Mental health assessments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 21
acceptance of the need for treatment and monitoring is often the most critical issue. By contrast,
a man with personality disorder needs to understand how certain of his habitual ways of dealing
with other people and with life events cause him and others distress. For a man undergoing a
course of behaviour therapy, understanding the origin of his problems is less important than
having the motivation to change and persist with therapy. In psychodynamic psychotherapy, the
emphasis is on understanding one’s habitual ego defences and ways of responding that have led
to problems in the past. Change occurs through the repeated working through of solutions that
have lead to maladaptive responses in the past in order to learn and consolidate new responses.
Diagnosis and formulation
Diagnoses are made according to criteria defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)1
 or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10)2
. By
contrast, a formulation is a narrative that brings together salient facts from a person’s life story in
order to make sense of his or her current problems. These include biological, psychological and
social factors that may predispose to, precipitate, perpetuate or protect against mental illness. Both
a diagnosis and a formulation are required in the comprehensive assessment of a person suffering
mental health problems. Differences between a diagnosis and a formulation are summarised in
Table 2-1.
Both a formulation and a diagnosis are required in the comprehensive
assessment of a person suffering mental health problems.
Table 2-1: Differences between a diagnosis and a formulation
Diagnosis Formulation
Nomothetic (i.e. assigns individuals to groups with
shared characteristics)
Ideographic (i.e. focuses on the uniqueness and
complexity of the individual)
Validity tested using scientific methods Validity judged on the basis of the reliability and
salience of the data used and the plausibility of
the interpretations made
Summary label, for example, ‘depression’ or
‘schizophrenia’
Narrative that answers the question, ‘Why is this
individual suffering these problems at this time?’

understanding of it)
Formulation
The different factors that make up a formulation are shown in Table 2-2.
Biological factors
Any physical disorder that directly or indirectly affects the central nervous system can influence
a person’s mental state. Similarly, drugs and other substances that gain access to the brain, or
that indirectly affect brain function, can cause mental symptoms. Mental symptoms commonly
arise as a psychological response to having a physical disorder. Genetic factors contribute to the
development of the psychoses, but also to disorders such as personality disorders and substance
abuse.

Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines. Geneva: World Health Organisation, 1992.
22
Psychological factors
A person’s personality, its strengths and vulnerabilities, can either predispose to mental illness or
protect against it. The 10 personality disorders described in the DSM-IV are discussed in Chapter
23. The psychodynamic assessment of personality covers patients’ characteristic defences, their
ability to control impulses, their ability to maintain self-esteem, the quality of their relationships,
and their capacity for shame and guilt (see Chapter 12).
Mental disorders are often precipitated by stress. The stressor may be an adverse event such as
a loss or a desirable one such as marriage. It could be a normal developmental challenge, for
example, an adolescent leaving home or a 65-year-old facing retirement. In general practice
populations, mental disorders commonly occur as a psychological response to having a physical
disorder. The stressor may have special significance for that individual in terms of his or her
history: for example, a relationship breakdown would be particularly stressful to a woman who
lost her parents during her childhood.
Social factors
Strong social supports are protective against mental illness and ensure a better prognosis. Limited
social support is a vulnerability. Stressful patterns of social interaction tend to perpetuate
mental illness. For example, a high level of expressed emotion (hostility, critical comments
and enmeshment) increases relapse rates in schizophrenia and depression. Unemployment is
associated with increased levels of both mental and physical morbidity. A person’s ethnic and
cultural background may predispose to the development of mental disorder and influence the
way in which symptoms are presented (see Chapter 4).

The following vignettes illustrate the different factors that make up a formulation. The numbers
refer to the boxes in Table 2-2. Most of these examples are best regarded as partial formulations
because they do not attempt to bring together all of the elements in a person’s history. However,
to avoid artificiality, some include more than the just the factor being illustrated.
1. Both parents of a 45-year-old man with schizophrenia were treated for the same condition.
Comment: He had a biological (genetic) predisposition to the development of schizophrenia.
With both parents suffering the condition, his lifetime risk at birth was around 45 per cent.
Note, however, that his identical twin brother, who has never suffered psychotic symptoms,
now has only a small risk of developing the illness because the onset almost always occurs
before the age of 40.
2a. A 60-year-old man who is alcohol dependent develops alcohol withdrawal delirium
three days after admission to hospital for repair of a fractured neck of femur.
Comment: The precipitant is the withdrawal from alcohol in a man who is alcohol dependent.
Other factors, including post-operative complications, could also be playing a part.
2b. A 65-year-old woman is admitted to a psychiatric ward with a diagnosis of
depression. In addition to her low mood, she describes loss of appetite, a threekilogram weight loss over the past two months and a loss of energy. She is convinced
she has cancer. On physical examination, she looks unwell. Her skin is sallow and
Mental health assessments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 23
she appears jaundiced. Subsequent investigation reveals carcinoma of the pancreas.
Comment: Depression is commonly associated with a number of medical conditions,
including carcinoma of the pancreas, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, stroke,
hypo- and hyper-thyroidism, hypo- and hyper-parathyroidism, SLE, hepatitis, infectious
mononucleosis and HIV. It is always important to consider an underlying physical illness
as the cause of psychiatric symptoms. Physical illnesses remain at the top of the diagnostic
hierarchy. There is always the danger of coming up with a plausible psychosocial formulation
for symptoms and missing the underlying physical condition.
3. A young man with schizophrenia is admitted to hospital with an exacerbation
of his psychotic symptoms (derogatory voices, delusions that he is being
chased). He has been smoking marijuana every day over the past three weeks
and he has used intravenous amphetamines three times over the past week.
Comment: The marijuana and amphetamines are likely to have precipitated his relapse. His
continued use will perpetuate the illness.
4. A 70-year-old widower is treated for an episode of major depression. Since his wife’s death
two years before, he has become socially isolated. As part of his rehabilitation, he is encouraged
to join a local bowls club. He also begins working as a volunteer for Meals on Wheels.
Comment: This vignette is given as an example of a biological protecting factor. His good
physical health enables him to play bowls and to participate actively in delivering Meals on
Wheels.
5. A 50-year-old violinist with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra presents with
anxiety, depression and agoraphobia. She has been unable to return to work since
suffering an epileptic seizure four months ago while on stage in the Performing Arts
Complex. Thorough neurological investigation has failed to reveal any abnormality.
The precipitant appears to have been fatigue coupled with withdrawal from
benzodiazepines. She is described pre-morbidly as being a perfectionistic, conscientious,
hardworking, and strong-minded person who is a capable and willing organiser.
Comment: Pre-morbidly, she demonstrates a number of obsessive–compulsive personality
traits (see Chapter 23). An important dynamic in people with these traits is the need to
feel in control. Her epileptic seizure, which occurred in public and involved incontinence,
represents an extreme loss of control for her. The blow to her self-esteem has resulted in
depressive symptoms. The fear of having another fit has lead to avoidance and agoraphobia.
6. and 7. A 50-year-old woman is brought to see you by her daughter. She has been unable
to leave the house unless accompanied by her daughter or her husband since having a
panic attack two months ago in the entrance to the Logan Plaza shopping centre. Her
daughter has been doing all the shopping recently and has been taking meals to her parents
every evening. She is beginning to feel tired and exasperated by the situation. The patient’s
husband is reportedly less concerned and, in fact, feels that his daughter is exaggerating
the problems. He has refused to see you. He works as a taxi driver and has over recent
years become suspicious that his wife is having an affair. Not a day goes by when he does
not interrogate her and he frequently drops home to check up on her during the day.
Comment: Her fear of having another panic attack has led to avoidance behaviour
(agoraphobia). This is reinforced by her husband’s suspiciousness and intimidation, and also
by the secondary gains of bringing her daughter closer and of being cared for by her.
8. A man with paranoid schizophrenia is an excellent chess player. Although unemployed,
he attends a chess club three times a week where he continues to perform well.
Comment: Although he suffers from schizophrenia, he is an intelligent man who is gifted at
chess. Playing and studying the game is largely a solitary occupation that presents few threats
to him. Indeed, the determination and single-mindedness that are features of his game
24
reflect a positive side of his paranoia.
9. A 13-year-old girl suffers from anorexia nervosa. Her father is an advertising executive
whose work often takes him interstate or overseas. He and his wife often entertain business
associates at home—she has a reputation as an excellent cook. She herself has struggled
with her weight over the years and is currently attending a weight loss centre. The girl
attends a private girls’ school where she is described as a good student who is always well
behaved. She also studies ballet. She has been on diets before, sometimes together with a
school friend, but these have never lasted longer than a few weeks. She has been dieting
now for three months. Her mother remembers her being upset at a family barbecue around
the time of onset when her paternal grandmother commented that she was looking fat.
Comment: The vignette is given to illustrate how social factors can predispose to the
development of mental illness. Certain societal forces, derived especially from advertising
and the popular press, dictate that women should be thin. This view is particularly prevalent
in the worlds of gymnastics, ballet, modelling and athletics. The complete formulation
would also include a number of other factors. Her mother’s preoccupation with dieting
suggests a possible genetic and/or learned component. Food often plays an important role
in communication within the families of anorexics. Such families may exhibit an orientation
towards success that limits the free expression of feelings, the respect for each individual’s
autonomy and the resolution of conflict. The precipitant appears to have been the critical
remark made by her grandmother. Pre-morbidly, she had several obsessive–compulsive
personality traits (perfectionism and conscientiousness). The anorexic symptoms can be seen
as an attempt by a girl with a fragile self-esteem to gain control at a time when she is
undergoing the physical and social role changes of adolescence. Moreover, the dieting itself
will interrupt her physical, social and cognitive development.
10. A 60-year-old widow presents with major depression. The precipitant was the anniversary of
the death of her husband a year ago. She had an ambivalent relationship with him. He was
an alcoholic and was both verbally and physically aggressive towards her and her children,
especially when he was intoxicated. A number of people commented on how well she seemed
to cope after the funeral. She had not cried and was soon back engaged in her usual activities.
Her father too was a violent man—the patient’s mother left him, taking the three children
with her when she was eight years old. The family had no subsequent contact with him. They
were notified five years later that he had died in a motor vehicle accident some months before.
Comment: Her depression has been precipitated by the anniversary of the death of her
husband, a man towards whom she has ambivalent feelings. On one hand, she is angry
because of the years of abuse she and her children suffered at his hands, and now, because
of his abandonment of her. She also feels guilty because she had often wished him dead.
On the other hand, she remains sad at the loss of her marital partner. The loss also rekindles unresolved issues over the loss of her father. Grief counselling will aim to help her
acknowledge, experience and work through these ambivalent feelings.
11. A young man with schizophrenia is admitted to hospital with his third exacerbation of
psychosis in the past six months. His mother describes considerable conflict at home. The
father has never been able to accept his illness, sees him as lazy and frequently criticises
him for not going out and getting a job. There is also marital conflict, frequently over
the patient. On a number of occasions, the young man’s father has given his wife the
ultimatum that either his son moves out of the house or he will. Several attempts have
been made to accommodate the young man away from home, but his mother remains
convinced that he is unable to look after himself and these attempts have generally only
lasted for about two weeks. He has usually run out of money and phoned his parents.
His father has driven around, collected all his belongings and taken him back home.
Comment: An important perpetuating factor in his illness is the high ‘expressed emotion’
(EE) at home. The three components are hostility, critical comments and enmeshment.

12. A 33-year-old man presents with his girlfriend of eight years and describes a 10-year
history of paranoid delusions that the members of a bikie gang are chasing him. His
girlfriend has managed to look after him and reassure him over this period. He has
never previously sought psychiatric help. He has managed to do some casual work
over the years as a painter, employed by his girlfriend’s brother. On this occasion, she
brought him to hospital because, for the first time, he had been talking about suicide.
Comment: The strong support he receives from his girlfriend is an important protecting factor.
On the other hand, this support may have prevented earlier treatment and so worsened his
prognosis.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 27
Suicidality and dangerousness
Around one in every 100 deaths in Australia is by suicide. The rate among people who have
had at least one admission to hospital for a depressive illness is five times that in the general
population. Men complete suicide at twice the rate of women. Of particular concern over the
past decade has been the alarming increase in the rate of suicide among young people, especially
young men living in rural areas. The rate in this group is around 36/100,000 per year.
Assessment of suicidality
Risk factors
Population studies reveal a number of risk factors for suicide.
1. Demographic factors
a) Age: In general, suicide risk increases with age. However, there is a peak for young men
between the ages of 15 and 24. For older women the risk actually falls.
b) Sex: Males complete suicide at rates around twice those for women. Young women are
at higher risk of self-harm.
c) People who are separated, divorced, widowed, single or living alone have an increased
risk. Caring for a child is protective.
2. Unemployment, retirement or a fall in socio-economic status
3. Previous attempts: A history of previous attempts increases the risk of completed suicide. Be
careful not to fall into the trap of thinking that because a person has repeatedly self-harmed
in the past that he or she will not complete suicide in the future. The risk increases with the
lethality of previous attempts. Knowing someone who has committed suicide, or having a
family history of suicide, increases risk. Copycat suicides may follow media coverage of the
suicide of high profile people or others with whom they identify. Previous attempts that
occurred in the absence of any clear precipitant indicate high risk.
4. Physical illness: especially chronic, severe, disabling or terminal illness
Physical illness that is chronic, severe, disabling or terminal is associated with
an increased risk of depression and suicide.
5. Mental disorder: especially major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline
and antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse. A history of impulsive behaviour
increases risk. Repeated deliberate self-harm is often associated with a history of childhood
abuse.
6. Symptoms: Hopelessness (the belief that things are not going to change, but stay bleak
into the future), anxious ruminations, severe psychic anxiety, global insomnia, psychotic
symptoms (especially delusions of poverty or doom) and recent alcohol abuse are predictors
of suicide. One study has calculated that 72 per cent of those with a suicide plan go on to
make a suicide attempt1
.

 Kessler RC, Borges G, Walters EE. Prevalence of and risk factors for lifetime suicide attempts in the
National Co-morbidity Survey. Archives of General Psychiatry 1999; 56:617-626.
28
Hopelessness, anxious ruminations, severe psychic anxiety, global insomnia,
delusions of poverty or doom, recent alcohol abuse and having a suicide plan
are associated with later suicidal behaviour.
7. Availability of means: Access to lethal means such as firearms increases risk.
8. Risk periods: early in treatment or soon after hospital discharge. A sudden unexplained
improvement can be a danger sign. The person may have decided to commit suicide. Suicide
attempts may occur on the anniversary of important losses.
The interview
The assessment of suicidality is summarised in Table 3-1.
1. Consider the person’s risk factors (as above).
2. Ask about suicidality. Begin by asking general questions (e.g. ‘Does it ever seem that life
is not worth living?’). Then proceed to more direct questions (e.g. ‘Have you thought of
harming yourself or even killing yourself?’). Clarify if the person has a suicide plan, how
specific it is, the lethality of means, whether it has been rehearsed and whether preparations
have been made for the person’s death (e.g. arranging insurance, finalising a will). There is
some evidence that asking about suicide may suggest it as a possible solution to life problems,
especially in adolescents who had not previously considered it as an option. Make sure that
you follow up the question with a discussion about alternative strategies for solving the
person’s problems, and seek an agreement that if ideas of suicide recur in the future, the
person will first seek help.
Ask about suicidality, but always be prepared to follow up the question with a
discussion about alternative solutions to the person’s problems.
3. Assess the suicidal act or intention. It is often useful to ask the person to describe what
happened in the days leading up to a suicide attempt. You will then understand the context
in which the attempt occurred and the meaning of the act. Was the act planned or done
on impulse? Was alcohol involved? Did the person expect to die or was another outcome
intended? Some people may take an overdose, for example, simply to get away from their
problems and to sleep. Others may expect to be rescued. Writing a note may demonstrate a
high level of intent.
Assess the lethality of the act by noting the means, the situation in which it occurred and
whether others were nearby. Ask about access to firearms and other means. The lethality of
the act may not correlate with the intent. For example, many people are unaware of the
potential fatal consequences of paracetamol overdose. Others may have truly expected a
minor overdose to have been fatal.
4. Assess the meaning of the act or intention. Assess the person’s reasons to die versus (his)
reasons to live. Assess the meaning to (him) of suicide and death. Risk is increased when this
takes on a positive meaning (e.g. identification or reunion with a loved one, or fantasies of
rebirth).
5. Assess the problem. Suicidal acts are attempts at solving problems in a person’s life. They often
occur in response to relationship difficulties. People who self-harm may do so in the belief
that they will elicit sympathy and restore threatened relationships. In reality, they more often
induce guilt and anger in others, and tend to drive people away rather than bring them closer,
especially when repeated suicide attempts are made. Clarifying the precipitating problem is
the first step in trying to resolve it. Listening to a person describe his or her problem will
itself provide some relief. You may be the first person who has taken the time to do this. Then
Suicidality and dangerousness
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 29
use the counselling and structured problem solving techniques described in Chapter 6 to
help the person resolve the crisis.
Suicidal acts are attempts at solving problems in the person’s life.
6. Assess any underlying mental disorder. Disorders associated with an increased risk of suicide
include major depression, bipolar disorder (especially during depressed or mixed episodes),
psychotic depression (especially with mood-congruent delusions), depression associated with
anxiety symptoms, panic disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personalty disorder, antisocial
personality disorder and alcohol abuse. The risk is increased when two or more disorders
coexist (e.g. depression and alcohol abuse). People in the early stages of recovery from
depression are at high risk. The person who was psychomotor retarded may find the energy
and motivation to complete suicide at this time. Repeated self-harm is often associated
with a history of childhood abuse. The impaired judgement of people who are intoxicated,
delirious or acutely psychotic places them at high risk. These people almost always require
hospital admission, often under regulation.
Disorders commonly associated with suicide include depression, panic disorder,
alcohol and substance abuse, and schizophrenia.
7. Is there an underlying physical disorder? People with severe physical illness, especially the
elderly, have an increased risk of suicide.
8. Ask about previous suicide attempts or self-harming behaviour. The frequency and seriousness
of these give an indication of current suicide risk.
9. Assess protective factors. Those with limited social supports are at high risk. On the other
hand, strong social supports are protective. The ability to mobilise supports is an important
factor in treatment. Assess other protective factors: guilt about the impact of suicide on the
person’s family (especially their children), fears of death and of the unknown, social stigma,
and religious proscriptions against suicide.
Management
1. Treat the physical sequelae of the suicide attempt. You may need to refer the person to
hospital for inpatient treatment.
2. Document the suicide risk assessment and the reasons for your actions.
3. Establish a therapeutic alliance. Listening to the person, being sensitive to verbal and nonverbal cues, and having an empathic style will promote open communication. Note, however,
Table 3-1: Assessment of suicidality
•	Consider the person’s risk factors.
•	Ask about feeling of hopelessness.
•	Ask about any plans for suicide.
•	Evaluate the context of any suicidal act and its meaning to the individual.
•	Assess the means used, and the lethality and intent of the act.
•	Ask about access to firearms and other means.
•	Clarify the problem that the suicidal act attempts to solve.
•	Diagnose underlying mental disorder.
•	Diagnose physical disorder.
•	Document past suicidal behaviour.
•	Assess the extent of social supports.
30
that once a person has decided to commit suicide, you will be seen as an adversary rather
than an ally. For this reason, it is important not to place too much reliance on a simple
denial of suicidal intent. A majority of people who complete suicide have not mentioned
their intention to their therapist, or have denied such an intention. On the other hand,
people often communicate their intentions to spouses or family, a fact that underlines the
importance of interviewing family members.
4. Ensure the person’s safety. Before sending a (man) home, you should aim to reach an
agreement that he is no longer suicidal and that if suicidal thoughts recur, he has a plan
for getting help before self-harming (see Table 3-2). The plan may involve telling a family
member of any suicidal thoughts, or of contacting you or the district mental health service.
When he cannot give such an assurance, or when his judgement is so poor that he is not
in a position to make such an agreement, it may be necessary to hospitalise him. You may
need to do this under the provisions of the Mental Health Act (see Chapter 22). Note that a
simple agreement not to commit suicide is of little value in itself, though a refusal to ensure
one’s own safety constitutes a significant risk.
5. Mobilise social supports. The safety agreement will usually require the cooperation of family
members or other close supports. The precipitating problem usually involves those who are
close to the person. A plan that has the agreement of everyone concerned is more likely to
succeed and all participants will share some responsibility for its implementation.
6. Diagnose and treat the underlying mental disorder. In the immediate aftermath of a suicide
attempt, explain the nature, causes, treatment and prognosis of the underlying condition to
the person and his or her carers. This will give the person a sense of control and help restore
hope.
7. Deal with your own and others’ emotional reactions. Suicidal behaviour evokes strong feelings
in those close to patients and in those who treat them. Monitor your countertransference to
ensure that these feelings do not distort your judgement. Common reactions include:
•	 denial – for example, you may find yourself colluding with the person who says that an
obviously serious suicide attempt was just an accident
•	 anger and distancing – you may, for example, dismiss a person’s suicidal thoughts as
merely manipulative or attention-seeking
•	 rescue fantasies – these might arise, for example, in response to a young woman who
repeatedly self-harms. Despite the inability of all her previous therapists to prevent these
distressing behaviours, you may be tempted to believe that you, and only you, can save her.
This may lead you to denigrate her other therapists and to take extraordinary measures to
save her, which may in turn lead to burnout and boundary violations. Taking desperate
measures to prevent a person from self-harming may only reinforce his or her feelings of
helplessness.
Table 3-2: Criteria for allowing a suicidal person to go home
•	The person no longer feels suicidal.
•	His or her medical condition is stable.
•	The person is able to promise to seek help before self-harming if suicidal ideas recur.
•	The person is not intoxicated, delirious or psychotic.
•	 Firearms have been removed from the home.
• Acute problems have been identified, and steps taken to begin to address them.
•	Treatment has been arranged for underlying psychiatric problems.
•	You feel confident that the person will follow through with the plan.
•	 Social supports have been contacted and they agree with the plan.
Suicidality and dangerousness
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 31
People who deliberately self-harm, or who threaten or attempt suicide, evoke
strong countertransference responses that can both inform and obstruct
treatment. These include denial, anger and impulses to rescue the person.
Some guidelines for the management of the person who repeatedly
self-harms
As a group, these are among the most difficult people to treat. They evoke strong countertransference responses that can both inform and obstruct treatment. Often these people have
been the victims of childhood abuse. A more detailed discussion of management issues can
be found in Chapter 23 in the section on borderline personality disorder. Below are some
suggestions about how you might approach the management of a young woman who repeatedly
presents to you with ideas or acts of self-harm.
1. Focus on the here-and-now issues surrounding the current crisis rather than going over past
problems, including those of past abuse. Leave dealing with those issues to her psychotherapist.
Try to identify the precipitating problem and use structured problem solving techniques to
resolve it. Sometimes the precipitant may not be an event, but rather an unpleasant affective
state, for example, a feeling of emptiness or boredom. She may have great difficulty accounting
for her actions. Nevertheless, persist in seeking to understand what the act means to her. The
initial goal of therapy is to find alternative ways of dealing with such crises.
2. Reach an agreement about ensuring her safety using the principles outlined above. If the
plan breaks down, use structured problem solving techniques to revise and improve it.
3. Set explicit limits about what you can and cannot do. Acknowledge that while you are
concerned about her self-harming behaviour and wish to help her, her safety is ultimately in
her own hands.
4. As a corollary, do not be drawn into desperate attempts at rescue. You may only reinforce
the young woman’s feelings that she is helpless and cannot take responsibility for her own
safety. You run the risk of becoming burnt out or of being drawn into desperate attempts at
treatment that may only worsen the problems.
5. Do not be too critical of others involved in her treatment. Talk to them and work together
with them towards common goals.
6. Monitor your countertransference and acknowledge negative feelings and impulses. By doing
so, you will be less likely to act out upon them.
7. She may at times present a paradox. After just having harmed herself, she may present with
a bland, even smiling affect. Do not collude with this denial. Always remain serious and
realistically concerned about her dangerous behaviour. Do not joke with her about her selfharming behaviour.
Always remain serious and realistically concerned about a person’s suicidal
behaviour.
When a patient commits suicide
Sadly, despite our best efforts at prevention, there are some people who will commit suicide. It
has been estimated that, on average, general practitioners will lose a patient by suicide around
once every six years1
. Note, however, that this figure varies from one practice to another. In
the aftermath of the suicide of a patient under your care, it is advisable to contact the family
1 Office of Health Economics. Suicide and deliberate self-harm. London: Office of Health Economics, 1981.
32
and offer to meet with them. Encourage discussion and ventilation of feelings. Acknowledge
that the grieving process after a suicide may be particularly painful, with conflicting emotions
of sadness, guilt, shame and anger (see Chapter 7). Consider attending the funeral. Contrary to
what you might expect, families are generally grateful for your attendance and are unlikely to
criticise you.
An audit of the case should be conducted with a group of colleagues. The focus should be on a
supportive review and what can be learned rather than on ‘what went wrong’. It is essential to
seek the support of a colleague at this time (see Chapter 25).
Dangerousness
One of the reasons for the stigma of mental illness is the commonly held belief that people
with mental disorders are dangerous. In fact, most individuals with mental disorders are not
violent and present no threat to others. In particular, the depressed and anxious people who are
commonly seen in general practice are probably less dangerous than people in the community
at large. However, it is true that, as a group, people with mental illnesses are around three to five
times more likely to commit acts of violence than the rest of the population1
. This increased
risk should be understood in context—it is about the same as that for young men. Moreover,
what is true for a group does not necessarily pertain to an individual member of that group.
For example, a young, isolated and unemployed man with schizophrenia who has a history
of violence and substance abuse and is currently delusionally jealous presents a relatively high
risk. By contrast, an elderly woman with well-controlled schizophrenia, who has strong social
supports and no history of violence, presents a minimal risk of dangerous behaviour.
With potentially dangerous or violent persons, the main goals, in order of priority, are:
1. self-protection
2. prevention of immediate violence
3. diagnosis and assessment of the risk of dangerousness
4. development of a treatment plan that includes measures to minimise the likelihood of
future violence.
Self-protection
Assume that violence is always a possibility and never allow yourself to be surprised by a sudden,
violent act. Know as much as possible about a person before seeing him or her. It is especially
important to know if the person has a past history of violence, and whether the person has access
to firearms or other weapons. Never interview an armed person. Never interview a potentially
violent person alone or in a room with the door closed. Never use a room with an internal
manually operated lock. Consider removing neckties, necklaces or other articles of clothing or
jewellery that the person can grab or pull. Stay within sight of other staff members.
Do not attempt physical restraint yourself. Do not give the person access to areas where weapons
may be available (e.g. syringes, furniture). A paranoid person may feel threatened if you sit
too close. Keep yourself at least at arm’s length from any potentially violent patient. Do not
challenge or confront a psychotic patient. Be alert to any signs of impending violence. In the
face of impending violence, leave the room. Trust your own instinct about this. If you feel afraid,
then leave. Always leave yourself a route for rapid escape in case the person attacks you. Never
turn your back on the patient. A common response of people who are angry is to walk out. Do
not obstruct their passage.

If you feel afraid during the interview, leave the room.
Prevention of immediate violence
The key to prevention is early detection and preventive action. Signs of impending violence
include recent violence against people or property, clenched teeth and fists, verbal threats or
menacing, wielding weapons or objects potentially useable as weapons, agitation, alcohol or
drug intoxication, paranoid delusions and command hallucinations.
Be supportive and non-threatening to potentially violent patients. Set limits by offering choices
(e.g. medication by alternative routes) instead of provocative directives (e.g. ‘Take this medicine
now.’). Tell them directly that violence is not acceptable. Reassure them that they are safe. Convey
an attitude of calm and control. If medication is offered, the person should be told that the aim
is to help him or her relax and gain more self-control. If medication is needed, choose the least
invasive route that is practical.
Diagnosis and assessment of the risk of dangerousness
Risk factors for violence include a statement of intent, a specific plan, the availability of means
(especially firearms), male sex, youth (15–24 years), a history of violence and other antisocial
acts, poor impulse control, abuse of substances (especially alcohol and amphetamines), low IQ,
family history of violence, history of childhood abuse, low socio-economic status, poor social
supports, history of suicide attempts and recent psychosocial stressors.
Psychiatric diagnosis on its own is a poor predictor of violence. Most people with mental
disorders are not violent. The associations of some mental disorders with an increased risk of
violence are listed in Table 3-3.
Psychiatric diagnosis alone is a poor predictor of violence. Risk factors include
a statement of intent, a specific plan, the availability of means (especially
firearms), male sex, youth (15–24 years), a history of violence and other
antisocial acts, poor impulse control, abuse of substances (especially alcohol
and amphetamines), low IQ, family history of violence, history of childhood
abuse, low socio-economic status, poor social supports, history of suicide
attempts and recent psychosocial stressors.
Table 3-3: Mental disorders associated with an increased risk of violence
•	substance abuse (especially alcohol and amphetamines)
•	withdrawal from alcohol and sedative hypnotics
•	 psychotic disorders (e.g. schizophrenia and delusional disorder), especially if the person has
persecutory delusions, command hallucinations to harm others1
, delusions or hallucinations that
cause unpleasant affects ( e.g. anxiety, anger or sadness)2
 , or delusions of infidelity
•	 depression, especially if associated with psychotic symptoms
•	mania is associated with assaultive or threatening behaviour though rarely with serious violence
•	 personality disorders characterised by rage and poor impulse control (e.g. borderline and antisocial
personality disorders)
•	 organic mental disorders (especially delirium, and frontal and temporal lobe disorders)

Treatment plan
Treat the underlying mental disorder and take steps to reduce the risk of future violence.
1. Warn the intended victim of any violent threat. Phone the police, the person under threat,
or his or her family or friends. The duty to warn takes priority over patient confidentiality.
2. Restrict the person’s access to weapons (especially firearms). A firearm prohibition order can
be arranged by writing to the police.
3. Treat any underlying mental disorder, if necessary, in hospital, under regulation.
4. If violence is related to a specific situation or person, try to separate the two.
5. If there is no evidence of a mental disorder, ask the person to leave and, if necessary, contact
the police.
If a person makes a direct threat against another, the duty to warn overrides
the need to maintain confidentiality.

Transcultural mental health issues
Culture and mental illness
Helman defines culture as a ‘set of guidelines (both explicit and implicit) which individuals
inherit as members of a particular society, and which tells them how to view the world, how to
experience it emotionally, and how to be behave in it in relation to other people, to supernatural
forces or gods, and to the natural environment’.1
Different cultures have different views on what constitutes mental illness. The definition depends
on what is regarded as normal and abnormal, and whether or not behaviours are within the
norms of the particular society. Mental illness is applied to those behaviours that are both
abnormal and outside these norms. Criminal behaviour is viewed as ‘normal’, but against the
norms of society. Certain abnormal behaviours are sanctioned in specific circumstances (e.g.
speaking in tongues or, in our society, the behaviour of footballers after winning a game).
The Western concept of mental illness tends to locate the problem within the individual sufferer,
whilst in many non-Western cultures, the problem is seen as belonging to the community as
a whole. There is a tendency within Western medicine to attempt to reduce illness to a single,
often physical cause. Psychoanalysis tends to reduce illness to experiences in the mind of the
individual. A theme of this book is to avoid such reductionism and to consider the range of
biological, psychological and social factors in the formulation of mental disorders. In many
societies, the spiritual dimension is of central importance.
The Western concept of mental illness tends to locate the problem within the
individual whilst in many non-Western cultures, the problem is seen to be one
of the community as a whole.
The ways that different cultures view mental illness influence their diagnostic systems. While
there are similarities in the forms of illnesses across different societies, the content of symptoms
and signs are specific to the society. For example, delusions and hallucinations occur in all
cultures but their contents differ. An Australian man with schizophrenia may complain that his
thoughts are being influenced by laser beams, while a man from Fiji may complain of black
magic interfering with his thoughts.
The forms of mental phenomena are similar in different societies, but their
content is specific to each.
A person’s culture also influences the manner in which he or she presents mental health
problems. In some cultures, psychological distress is more commonly expressed through somatic
complaints than through mental symptoms. Some languages have a paucity of words to describe
emotions and other subjective experience. The way that people present their problems and
seek treatment is shaped by their culture, and the symptoms and signs tend to fall into patterns
recognised within it. The sick role is defined by a number of culturally specific entitlements and
obligations of the person who is ill.
Chapter 4

In some cultures, psychological distress is usually expressed through somatic
complaints.
Just as the formulations of people’s problems in non-Western societies involve the whole
community, so do the prescribed treatments. An unfortunate consequence of Western societies’
focus on the individual is the tendency to treat a person in isolation from his or her community.
The high priority placed on confidentiality and the right to privacy reflects core values in
Western society. A corollary of this attitude is the stigma of mental illness in Western societies.
In Western societies, a high priority is placed on confidentiality. As a corollary,
people with mental health problems are often stigmatised and treated in
isolation from the rest of their community.
By contrast, the involvement of the community in both the formulation of the problem and in
its treatment in non-Western societies means that the person, rather than being excluded from
society, becomes instead a focus of community attention and support. Indeed, the process of
healing is often a powerful cohesive force within these societies. This may, in part, explain why
people in non-Western societies who suffer psychotic illnesses have a better prognosis than
people in the West. Treatments in non-Western societies usually involve the family. In the West,
deinstitutionalisation has meant that a greater responsibility for care falls on families who are
now routinely involved in treatment.
The better prognosis of psychosis in non-Western societies may in part be due
to the involvement of the community in both the formulation of the problem
and its treatment.
There are certain common features of non-pharmacological treatments across different cultures.
All involve a mythic belief system that the healer communicates to the sufferer. The healer
makes links between the myth and the problems of the individual. The individual is engaged
emotionally in the treatment. Therapeutic change is achieved by reframing the problem in terms
of the myth. The person gains a sense of mastery and a new explanatory narrative of his or her
experience. This is as true of psychoanalysis as it is of various forms of spiritual healing in nonWestern societies.
There are features common to all effective forms of psychotherapy.
When people move from one culture to another they suffer a variety of stressors and their
rates of mental illness are higher than for people in the host society and in their society of
origin. To some extent, this may be explained by the fact that people with a history of mental
illness seem to be more likely to migrate, but it also has to do with the stresses of migration.
Refugees are at higher risk than voluntary migrants, especially those who have been traumatised
by war or experiences of torture. The change of culture, including language, is a significant
stressor. Immigrants often suffer a loss in social and occupational status if their qualifications
are not recognised. Family incomes are often low and unemployment levels high. People may
be forced to live in overcrowded conditions with few amenities. Immigrants may suffer racial
discrimination. Conflict may arise between parents and their locally born children.
Migration is a stressful event that can precipitate mental illness.
Consider the guidelines in Table 4-1 when interviewing a person from a non-English cultural
background.
Transcultural mental health issues
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 37
The interpreted interview
When a person cannot communicate fluently with you in English you should use a professional
interpreter. This will not interfere with the doctor–patient relationship. On the contrary, by
ensuring that you understand the person’s complaint, and that he or she understands your
explanations and instructions, you will deliver better care. Both on-site and telephone
interpreting can be organised through the Translating and Interpreting Service (TIS) in each
state and territory.
It is generally not advisable to use other staff (for example a secretary) or other family members
to interpret. Messages may be altered, censored, distorted, normalised or presented in a highly
subjective way. There may be a lack of knowledge of specific medical terminology. There may
also be a lack of awareness of such ethical issues as confidentiality. The use of a child as interpreter
for his or her parents may distort the authority relationships within the family and can be
embarrassing to both child and parent. Important information may be withheld.
It is generally inadvisable for staff or family members to act as interpreters.
In certain situations, the use of an interpreter is mandatory:
•	seeking informed consent
•	communicating the results of diagnostic tests
•	giving pre- or post-operative instructions
•	discussing the diagnosis of a terminal illness
•	dealing with situations that involve domestic violence
•	treating mental illness
•	breaking bad news (see also Chapter 7).
On-site interpreting
Before the interview, make sure that extra time has been set aside for the consultation with
the interpreter. When complex information needs to be communicated, it is wise to brief the
interpreter before the interview. During the interview, always speak directly to the person,
addressing him or her in the second person. Avoid having the conversation with the interpreter.
At the beginning of the interview, introduce yourself and the interpreter and explain your roles.
Explain that the interview will remain confidential. During the interview, speak slowly and
Table 4-1: Assessing the person from a non-English cultural background
•	Ask the person his or her preferred form of address. Do your best to pronounce the name
correctly.
•	Where possible, involve the family in treatment, but not as interpreters.
•	Be informed by what you know about disease process, but do not neglect to try to understand
the person’s experience and the illness.
•	The focus is often on healing (or coping, rehabilitation and disability support) rather than cure.
•	 Set aside at least twice the usual time. If you use an interpreter, the consultation will always take
longer.
•	You will often have to work slowly from first principles in making a diagnosis, rather than relying
on your skills in pattern recognition.
•	Whenever there are language difficulties, use an interpreter.
•	Ask the person and his or her family about the meaning of the symptoms and signs within their
culture of origin, and their understanding of the diagnosis and treatment.
•	Be careful not to ascribe psychopathology to symptoms and signs that are not abnormal with the
person’s culture of origin.
•	 On the other hand, do not dismiss complaints as just normal cultural variants.
38
use short sentences in plain English. Pause after two or three sentences to allow the interpreter
to communicate what you have said. Summarise the discussion periodically throughout the
interview. At the end of the interview, ask the person if he or she has any questions. Consider
debriefing the interpreter after the interview.
Set aside extra time for an interpreted interview.
Telephone interpreting
This form of interpreting is not suitable for complex interviews. If using dual handsets, speak a
little softer than usual. When using a conference phone, you and the patient may need to speak
a little louder in order for the interpreter to hear you both.
Consent for procedures
When obtaining consent for surgical or other procedures, always ask an interpreter to be present
in a face-to-face interview. On the consent form, include a statement signed by the interpreter
indicating that he or she has translated all of the necessary details for the person.
Always use an interpreter in a face-to-face interview when gaining consent for
surgical or other procedures.
Indigenous mental health issues
The standards of physical and mental health among indigenous people in Australia are poor in
comparison with the wider community. Life expectancy is 20 years less than for non-indigenous
people. The main causes of this excess morbidity are diabetes, cardiovascular disease, peripheral
vascular disease, lung disease, kidney disease and accidents. It has been estimated that alcohol is
a contributing factor in as many as 50 per cent of premature deaths1
.
Alcohol is a contributing factor to the low life expectancy of indigenous
Australians.
Knowledge of the epidemiology of mental disorders among indigenous people is limited. Early
studies were flawed, because they relied on information from non-indigenous sources and used
Western diagnostic instruments. More recent studies estimate the prevalence of mental disorders
in indigenous people to be between 35 per cent2
 and 54 per cent3
. Indigenous Queenslanders
are more than twice as likely as other Queenslanders to be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric
facility. However, indigenous people are thought to be under-represented among those attending
community mental health services4

There is a high prevalence of depression and anxiety. In a study of one community in Adelaide,
25 per cent of Aboriginal adults had attempted suicide at some time in their lives1
. The rate
of suicide for indigenous young men between the ages of 15 and 24 is three and a half times
higher than for other Queensland men in this age group2
. Rates of alcoholism are high with
levels between 32 per cent and 65 per cent reported in men, and between 3 per cent and 51
per cent in women, in different communities3
. Among children and young people, there is a
high prevalence of conduct disorder. The rate of incarceration among 15 to 19 year old boys is
25 times that of non-indigenous youth. There are also high rates of alcohol and substance use
(including marijuana and petrol sniffing) among indigenous youth.
The severe social disadvantage under which many indigenous Australians live may partly explain
these high rates of mental disorders. As a group, indigenous people are poorly educated, live in
overcrowded conditions, suffer a low standard of housing, and have high levels of poverty and
unemployment. Their physical health is poor. Families are disrupted with high rates of parental
discord, domestic violence and substance abuse. Children frequently suffer neglect and abuse.
Severe social disadvantage may partly explain the high rates of mental
disorders amongst indigenous people.
The current social situation of indigenous Australians can be understood in terms of the history
since white settlement. Throughout the world, the worst outcomes for indigenous peoples
following colonisation have occurred when there has been no formal treaty or settlement
regarding the transfer of lands, and where the national government has not been in control of
indigenous affairs. In Australia, there were no treaties, and the Federal Government only took
over responsibility for indigenous affairs after the referendum in 1967.
In the early days of white settlement, Aboriginal families were forced to move away from their
traditional lands to make way for farmers and other settlers. They were often resettled on land
that was far from their homelands, in places where they could not practice their traditional
ways of life. In the process, extended family groups, fundamental to indigenous culture were
often broken up. Government and church agencies took over many of the traditional roles of
people in these communities and so further contributed to the loss of identity suffered by these
displaced people. Up until the mid 1960s many indigenous children, especially young girls, were
taken from their families and brought up in orphanages or within non-indigenous households.
The separation of young people from their families continues to this day with many young
men being incarcerated in juvenile justice facilities. In a recent Victorian study, 49 per cent of
respondents had been separated from both of their parents for significant periods of time before
they were 14 years old4
.
The impact of these events is evident today. The multiple losses suffered as a consequence of
colonisation—the loss of land, family connections, culture and health—has had a profound
effect on the identity and consequently on the health of indigenous Australians. The anger of
many young Aboriginal men can be seen as a response to these events. In the face of this loss of
identity, many turn to alcohol.

The multiple losses suffered by indigenous people as a result of colonisation
have had a profound effect on Aboriginal identity.
Indigenous cultures’ recognition of mental illness is demonstrated in language. There are many
Aboriginal words to describe abnormal mental states and behaviours (e.g. ‘womba’ and ‘wangi
wangi’). Moreover, there appears to be a high tolerance of abnormal behaviour. Disturbed people
are usually cared for by their families with women often having to carry the main burden of care.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait culture has a holistic concept of health, embracing not just physical
and mental health, but also cultural and spiritual well being. Disturbance in an individual is
viewed as reflecting a community problem. Mental disturbance, especially when severe, is often
seen as a spiritual problem and spiritual treatments may be used. Traditional healers play a vital
role in the care of indigenous people with mental health problems.
Aboriginal culture has a holistic concept of health, embracing not just physical
and mental health, but also cultural and spiritual well being.
When treating an indigenous person with a mental health problem, be mindful of cultural
differences. A failure to do so may lead to misdiagnosis. Culturally normal behaviours may be
mistaken for psychotic symptoms and be treated inappropriately with antipsychotic medications.
On the other hand, important symptoms of distress may be mislabelled as normal cultural
variants. If possible, engage the services of a local indigenous community member or health
professional to assist the assessment and ongoing care.
There are no formal guidelines or protocols put forward by Queensland Health for the assessment
and treatment of an indigenous person who is suffering a mental health problem. However,
consider the following suggestions that are taken from a training video1
.
1. Set aside extra time. The interview is likely to take longer than usual.
2. Explain your role and the sort of things you are going to ask.
3. Remember that you may be viewed as a member of a culture that has caused damage to
indigenous culture—anticipate some anger, resentment or suspicion.
4. Be careful about using direct questions. They may be perceived as threatening and intrusive
and be met by a hostile response.
5. Avoid using medical and other technical jargon.
6. Recognise that vague and non-specific answers may reflect the discomfort of the person
being interviewed.
7. Indigenous people may avoid direct eye contact. This is regarded as polite within indigenous
culture.
8. Be aware of the following cultural prohibitions:
•	 referring to a dead person by name
•	 referring to certain close relatives by name (for example, a Torres Strait Islander male may
not refer to his brother-in-law by name)
•	 criticising an elder (older people are treated with great respect within traditional
cultures)
•	 confiding certain personal information to a member of the opposite sex (men’s and
women’s business are usually kept separate)
•	 criticising members of the extended family (family loyalties are strong).

 9. In assessing the mental state of an indigenous person remember the following:
•	 Hallucinations may not necessarily be psychotic phenomena. For example, it is normal
for the bereaved to see and hear the voice of a deceased family member. Other family
members are also likely to share the experience, which is usually perceived as reassuring.
These phenomena usually do not persist longer than a month after the relative’s death.
•	 Limited eye contact, and softly spoken and brief answers may merely indicate that the
person is shy or being polite.
•	 Anger and obscene language directed at you may reflect past experience by that person,
or his or her family, of exploitation and hardship inflicted by members of your own
culture.
10. Consider carefully the appropriateness of any cognitive tests that you use. Take into account
the education and living situation of the person being tested. Tests such as counting backwards,
spelling and remembering a sentence may be perceived as demeaning and precipitate a
hostile response.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 43
Family and marital problems
Many of the mental health problems seen in general practice are problems in couples, or in
families, rather than in an individual. In cases where an individual suffers a mental illness, the
impact of the illness on the family, and the way that family factors affect the person with the
illness, are important components in the assessment and treatment.
General practitioners are not expected to provide formal family therapy or relationship
counselling. However, they need to be confident in assessing and formulating family and marital
problems, and in providing basic counselling and appropriate referral.
Family problems
Family perspective
Family assessment requires a change in perspective from viewing an individual with a mental
disorder to viewing the interactions within a social system in which difficulties exist. When one
member of a family does suffer a mental (or physical) illness, this wider perspective encompasses
not only the way that the illness affects the individual, but also the meanings that other members
of the person’s family ascribe to his or her behaviour, how they respond, how their behaviour
feeds back on to the individual and on other family members, and the impact of the family’s
response on the person’s illness. One looks for circular patterns of causality (a→b→c ---→a),
rather than simple linear causality (a→b).
In assessing a family system, look for patterns of circular rather than linear
causality.
Family functioning
Individuals are members of a wide variety of social systems—at school, at work, and in recreation
and sporting clubs. People with chronic mental disorders belong to systems of mental health
care that include mental health staff, rehabilitation agencies and general practitioners. The most
fundamental social system to which we belong is the family. There are a number of ways of
viewing the structure and function of families:
• The commonest structure in our society is the nuclear family. However, a large number
of variants exist, including the single-parent family, the extended family and the blended
family.
• Like individuals, families undergo developmental changes throughout their life cycle. There
are wide variations, but some of these are as follows: two young people leave their families of
origin, meet, become engaged and marry; the first child is born, and second and subsequent
births follow; the first child starts pre-school and then moves on to primary school; the
youngest child starts school, leaving no children at home during school hours; the children
pass through adolescence, develop greater autonomy, form intimate relationships outside the
family of origin and leave home; and the final period between the parents’ retirement and
their death. Each of these transitions requires individual family members and the system as a
whole to change. Illness and other significant stressors can interfere with this developmental
process. On the other hand, developmental changes may precipitate mental illness in an
individual.
Chapter 5

A family, like an individual, undergoes developmental changes throughout its
life cycle.
• A family’s cohesiveness is evident in the loyalty of individual members to each other and
their ability to work together. It is compromised when there is severe conflict between family
members, when opposing alliances form or when one member is made a scapegoat.
• Each generation influences subsequent generations. The way that a man is reared affects the
way he rears his own children. Aspects of the identity of a family as a whole are also passed on
to the next generation. In some families, a ‘myth’ about the family is handed down from one
generation to the next—for example, that ‘The Smiths are a stubborn lot.’
• Within the family system are a variety of subsystems. In well-functioning families, the strongest
bond is that between the parents. Other subsystems include those between the children,
between members of the same sex, and between those sharing common interests. Problems
can arise when one subsystem is in conflict with another, for example, when a mother and her
daughter begin making family decisions more appropriately the responsibility of the parents.
• Boundaries between subsystems need to be both clear and flexible. Patterns of diffuse
boundaries, typical of enmeshed families, may produce highly cohesive family units but at
the expense of the autonomy of the individual members. On the other hand, families with
excessively rigid boundaries may promote individual autonomy but leave the members
isolated and unsupported in times of stress.
Boundaries between family subsystems need to be clear, but flexible.
• Different patterns of communication exist between individuals in the family and between the
different subsystems of the family. Certain patterns may characterise the family as a whole.
Styles of communication vary in amount, clarity and the way people respond. Conflict
between verbal and nonverbal communications can lead to misunderstandings, uncertainty
and anxiety.
• Families often have a pervasive atmosphere that can be described, for example, as lively, critical,
suspicious, earnest, chaotic, good-humoured or tense. The range of emotional expression may
be limited to one predominant affect, such as anger. In other cases, there may be an absence
of emotional expression. In families with a limited range of emotional expression, emotional
distress may be communicated through somatic symptoms or aberrant behaviours.
In families with a limited range of emotional expression, distress may be
expressed through the development of somatic symptoms or behaviour
problems.
• Families differ in how effectively they deal with stressors, whether meeting the normal
developmental challenges of their members or coping with other life events. Following a
stress to a social system, such as a family member developing a mental illness, the system
changes and eventually reaches a new equilibrium, a process analogous to the functioning
of physiological systems in maintaining homeostasis. Stressors may be external to the family
(e.g. financial difficulties or unemployment of a principal breadwinner) or internal (e.g. the
developmental challenges of individuals or of the family as a whole, or illness of a family
member). Stressors may be adverse (e.g. the death of a family member) or benign events (e.g.
the birth of a child). Families may grow in response to a challenge or be set back.
Family and marital problems
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 45
The well-functioning family
Some characteristics of the well-functioning family are listed below:
• The members of the family like each other.
• There are clear boundaries between subsystems with well-understood rules about their
different roles. In particular, the parental bond is the strongest in the family and its role in
making major decisions about the family and the children is acknowledged.
• Communication is clear and unambiguous.
• The family as a whole and the individual members respond to stressors effectively and
cooperatively.
• The family is able to provide for the normal dependency needs of its members (by, for
example, providing support and nurturance during illness), while at the same time promoting
each individual’s autonomy and development.
A well-functioning family meets the normal dependency needs of its members
while, at the same time, promoting each individual’s autonomy.
• The family provides a model of socialisation that can be transferred to relationships in the
outside world. Specifically, the parents provide models for identification by the same-sex
offspring.
Mental illness and the family
The relationship between mental illness and the family is complex (see example in Box 5-1).
Techniques for interviewing families
As a general practitioner, you are not expected to deliver formal family therapy. Moreover, since
you will often be treating individual family members, it may be difficult, if not impossible, not
to take sides. It may also be difficult to maintain confidentiality when some information has
been given to you in confidence by individuals, and other information has been shared with the
family as a whole.
Different schools of family therapy advocate different techniques: structural, strategic, the
Milan school and psycho-educational. In general practice the techniques for interviewing
the individual patient are applicable—listening, clarifying, using an empathic approach, asking
directive psychological questions, and responding to verbal and non-verbal cues. The techniques
of counselling, structured problem solving and supportive psychotherapy are also used (see
Chapters 6 and 8).
Psycho-education is an important component of the treatment of all mental disorders. Families
need to know about the symptoms, signs, relapse signatures, treatments and prognosis of illnesses
suffered by their members, and where they can get help in an emergency. With the move from
institutional to community care for people suffering a mental disorder, much of the responsibility
for care now falls on families.
Family psycho-education is an important component of the treatment of all
mental disorders.

Box 5-1: Mental illness and the family
In a well-functioning family, a person with an illness is supported by the other family members.
Russell, who suffers from schizophrenia, lives in a granny flat at the back of his mother’s house. She
knows his general practitioner and psychiatrist well and contacts them if she sees signs of relapse or
any other deterioration in his condition. His brothers take him on holidays with their families and are
able to offer him work from time to time.
The illness of one individual causes another to become symptomatic.
•	A woman with delusional disorder believes that the neighbours are involved a criminal group that
facilitates illegal migration to Australia. Since giving information to the police, she is convinced
that her own life is at risk. She insists that her 10-year-old son stay home from school in case he is
abducted. The boy has also begun to believe that the neighbours are a threat to him.
•	In the face of caring for his wife who suffers dementia, a man develops major depression.
A problem in the family causes an individual to be labelled as unwell.
A couple bring their 11-year-old son to see you because of behaviour problems at home. There are no
complaints of behaviour problems at school. Over the last two years, there have been increasing marital
problems and both parents have confided their difficulties in the boy.
A problem in the family is manifest by an individual becoming symptomatic.
A man becomes depressed in the face of worsening marital conflict.
A person’s illness is exacerbated by problems in the family system.
Louise has frequent admissions to hospital following exacerbations of her schizophrenic illness. Her
symptoms usually improve dramatically shortly after admission. She lives with her parents who, since
neither is employed, spend most of their time home. There is conflict over her illness, her mother
spending a lot of time supporting her, and her father often critical, insisting she is lazy and should be
working.
A person’s illness causes problems in the family system.
•	A woman with obsessive–compulsive disorder insists that her husband assist her in her rituals. At
times, he is up until 1.00am as she completes her showering and cleaning rituals before going to
bed.
•	 Since the onset of Steven’s schizophrenic illness, his mother has become his principal support. His
16-year-old brother has been increasingly resentful of the attention that Steven receives and he
complains that nobody is interested in anything that he does. He is threatened with suspension from
school because of rudeness to teachers and fighting.
A person’s illness is a ‘solution’ to problems in the family.
Following the onset of Tracey’s schizophrenic illness, her mother devotes an increasing amount of
time to supporting her. She always attends appointments, asking to be present even when Tracey has
Modecate injections. Meanwhile, Tracey’s father spends more time at work and the local bowls club,
and less time at home. Tracey’s mother confides in her about the marital problems.
Physical illness can also interfere with normal developmental tasks of individuals within a family.
Andrew is a 15-year-old young man whose diabetic illness has been poorly controlled recently. His
parents are anxious and upset. Until recently, they carefully monitored his blood sugar and insulin dose.
However, over the past three months, he has resisted their involvement, insisting he will manage his
insulin himself.
Comment: Andrew’s developmental demands for greater autonomy are in conflict with the limitations
placed on him by the illness and by his parents’ desire to maintain some surveillance and control over
the treatment. His distress is expressed through his poor compliance. Treatment would involve seeking
an agreement with his parents that he will take greater control of his treatment, and to help Andrew
grieve the losses and the limitations associated with having the illness, to gain a greater acceptance of
it and to improve his compliance with treatment.
Family and marital problems
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 47
In interviewing families, it is important to respect the existing power structures within the
family, but at the same time to facilitate each individual having his or her say. A useful technique
is circular questioning in which each individual is asked in turn his or her opinion on the
particular matter in question, and then to respond to what the others have said
Transference and countertransference
Unless recognised, certain common patterns of countertransference can interfere with therapy.
Acknowledge to yourself if you do not like an individual family member and take care that this
does not bias your interventions. Having a particular liking for one individual can also interfere
with therapy. Your judgement may also be distorted if the problems in the family are similar
to problems in your own family. The best solution in such cases may be to refer the family
elsewhere.
Having a strong liking or dislike for a family member can interfere with
therapy.
Indications for family therapy
• child and adolescent emotional or behaviour problems
• family member with a serious mental disorder—in particular, a person with schizophrenia
living in a family with high levels of expressed emotion, or a girl with a recent onset of
anorexia nervosa
• families in crisis
• families in which the developmental tasks of its members are delayed
• when family factors are causing, maintaining or exacerbating an individual’s mental illness
• families with boundary problems—for example, enmeshment or isolation
• families with serious communication problems.
Contraindications
• where there are cultural prohibitions
• child sexual or physical abuse – In such cases the priority is to ensure the safety of the victim.
Confronting the perpetrator in family therapy mislabels the problem as a family problem and
may lead him or her to retaliate against the person who discloses the abuse.
Family therapy is contraindicated in families in which there is child abuse.
• families with paranoid individuals who oppose therapy
• when destructive marital secrets may be revealed
• when addressing the problems of a late adolescent within the family as a whole risks
compromising his or her growing autonomy – While some family intervention may be
indicated, it is essential to see the adolescent on his or her own and to respect the confidentiality
of the consultation.
Marital counselling
Around 40 per cent of marriages in Australia end in divorce. The break-up of a marriage is
one of life’s most stressful events. The annual cost of marital difficulties in Australia has been
48
estimated to be two billion dollars a year1
. Twenty per cent of assaults reported to the police
and twenty-five per cent of murders occur between spouses. People suffering marital distress
pay more frequent visits to their general practitioners, sometimes with ill-defined somatic
complaints. Marital distress is associated with higher rates of depression, substance abuse, sexual
dysfunction, marital violence, accidents, heart disease and cancer. The children of couples with
marital problems are prone to behaviour problems, school problems and depression. Children
who witness parental violence are at risk of entering abusive relationships later in life, as victim
or abuser.
Marital distress is associated with higher rates of depression, substance abuse,
sexual dysfunction, marital violence, accidents, heart disease and cancer.
Presentation
One or other partner may present to you because of the marital problem. However, in many
cases he or she will present with some other problem—ill-defined physical symptoms (headaches,
gastro-intestinal symptoms), substance abuse, injuries, depression or sexual problems. Children of
troubled couples may be brought to see you because of depression or behaviour problems.
Formulation
Problems in marriages can be viewed from a number of perspectives. Using a systems approach,
one considers the interactions between the couple rather than looking for a problem in one or
other individual. Instead of seeking a single cause of the problem, one looks for circular patterns
of causality in which one event triggers others that eventually feed back on the original event.
Individuals may have different expectations of their relationship. For example, a man may be
distressed because his wife does not share aspects of her life with him—her work, the time
she spends with her female friends and her sporting activities. There may be communication
problems. Partners may be unable to discuss their difficulties.
Marital problems may arise in the face of stress—when both partners are unemployed, when a
member of the family suffers an illness, or at times of developmental change within the family,
such as the birth of a child.
From a psychodynamic perspective, one may see patterns in relationships that cross generations.
For example, the man who has a conflicted relationship with his mother may unconsciously
behave towards his wife in the same way as he does towards his mother. Here, the image he has
of his wife is in conflict with her real identity. Instead of recognising and confirming her identity,
he coerces her to conform to his image of her.
Marital therapy
One of the prerequisites for performing marital therapy is that the therapist is disinterested,
taking sides with neither partner. For the general practitioner, this is often impossible as he
or she is already treating one or both partners for individual problems and is a confidante of
each. In such cases, referral should be made for marital therapy. Organisations offering this
service include Relationships Australia, Lifeline, Catholic Family Services and other counselling
centres.
The main role of the general practitioner is in the detection of marital problems. You may also
provide information to the couple about the resources available to help them, including written
material2
. Use counselling and structured problem solving to help deal with crises. In cases of

marital violence, provide information about crisis support and accommodation, social security
and legal sanctions.
Indications for referral for marital therapy include chronic, multiple and severe problems, limited
problem solving capacity, and associated mental disorder (depression, substance abuse) in one or
other partner. Some techniques used by marital therapists are listed below.
• The focus is generally on the relationship and interactions between the partners rather than
on one individual’s problems.
• The couple are often asked to sit facing each other rather than the therapist. This facilitates
direct communication.
• Circular questioning involves the therapist asking one person a question about the other, and
then asking the other to respond.
• In reciprocal negotiation, a complaint of one partner is re-formulated as a wish. A task
that fulfils this wish is then negotiated between the two. The other person is also given the
opportunity to express a wish, and a task is then agreed upon to realise it.
• The therapist carefully observes the way that the couple communicate, noting problems such
as those listed below:
1. expressing thoughts in an intellectual, debating style, but without the expression of
emotion
2. a lack of empathy for the other
3. failing to listen
4. monologues in which one partner acts as spokesperson while the other submits
5. one partner stating how the other feels instead of allowing the other to state this for
him/herself
6. wandering off the topic
7. constant criticism with little positive reinforcement.
Generally, the therapist will interpret the communication problem and then ask the couple to
rehearse a different style.
• The therapist may ask the couple to have an argument over some real, though minor, problem.
This is a useful way of getting the subservient partner in a relationship to rehearse expressing
his or her views and being more assertive.
• Another technique is for the therapist to ask each partner to role-play the response of the
other to a given situation. This enhances empathy.
• The couple may be asked to set aside time for pleasurable activities or for tasks agreed to in a
reciprocal negotiation. Time may be set aside to discuss a particular problem.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 51
Crisis intervention, counselling and structured problem
solving
Crisis intervention, counselling and structured problem solving are techniques used to help
people who are under stress. Stress is a person’s response to an event that requires him or her
to change. A stressor may be either an adverse event, such as bereavement, or a desirable one,
such as a promotion. Likewise, the outcome of facing a stressor can be positive or negative. A
person under stress may or may not have an intercurrent mental illness. People with personality
disorders are especially prone to stress. Their lives are frequently chaotic, and their maladaptive
coping mechanisms mean that they often exacerbate or avoid their problems rather than find
effective solutions to them. Some common stressors are listed in Table 6-1.
Stressors include both adverse and desirable events.
Elevated levels of arousal caused by a stressor initially lead to improved coping. However, when
the levels of arousal rise above a certain point, coping deteriorates and can lead to decompensation
(see Figure 6-1).
Increased arousal initially improves coping, but excessive arousal can lead to
decompensation.
The ways of dealing with these two situations are quite different. The person who is under stress
receives counselling and is taught structured problem solving (see Figure 6-2), while the person
who is decompensated first undergoes crisis intervention.
Chapter 6
Table 6-1: Common stressors
1. losses – bereavement
 – separation/divorce
 – response to major surgery or medical illness
 – financial loss
2. life changes – new job

3. relationship problems
4. others – housing

Under stress Decompensation
Coping
 Arousal
Crisis intervention
The aim is to decrease the level of arousal until the person in crisis can return to his or her
normal level of coping. As soon as this is achieved, responsibility for the problems is handed back
to him or her, and counselling and problem solving can begin. Some of the steps used in crisis
intervention are listed below. An example is given in Box 6-1.
Crisis intervention aims to decrease the decompensated person’s level of
arousal so that he or she can begin to cope effectively with his or her
problems.
• Temporarily take over responsibility for the problems.
• Remove the person from the stressful situation. In some cases, it may even be necessary to
arrange a brief admission to hospital.
• Lower the person’s level of arousal by listening, encouraging the person to ventilate his or
her feelings and providing reassurance. A brief course of a benzodiazepine may sometimes
be appropriate.

• Diagnose and treat any mental disorder.
• When the person’s judgement has returned to normal, offer counselling and structured
problem solving.
Counselling
The aim is for the person to cope as well as possible with the stressor. The problem is not treated
as an illness. The person is not treated as being ‘sick’ but rather as a coping adult. The theory
of counselling is that through facilitating the expression of feelings about the stressor in the
context of a good therapeutic alliance, the person will be able to clarify and understand his or
her problems better and solve them rationally to the best of his or her ability.
Counselling and structured problem solving aim to help people cope to the
best of their ability with their problems.
Counselling begins by understanding and clarifying the problem. Some steps you might take in
counselling (a woman) are listed below:
• Listen as she describes the stressful situation or event.
• Reflect back what she says and clarify her account of what has happened.
• Allow her to ventilate her feelings.
• Empathise with how she feels.
• Try to make sense of any precipitants. These may have special meaning in terms of her past
history. For example, the loss of a loved one may rekindle grief over past losses.
• Take note of any dysfunctional ways of coping, for example alcohol or other substance abuse,
aggression or violence.
• Ask how she has dealt with similar problems in the past.
• Ask how she has dealt with other stressful events.
Structured problem solving
The next step is to help her use structured problem solving to deal with the stressor (see Table
6-2). This Table is reproduced as a handout for patients in Appendix 3.
Structured problem solving helps people find effective and rational solutions to
their problems.
Box 6-1: Example of crisis intervention
A 35-year-old single man is involved in a car accident in which he is uninjured, but the young woman
driving the other vehicle is killed. He presents to you two days after the accident complaining of
insomnia, poor concentration and constantly experiencing vivid images of the accident. He has been
chain smoking and drinking heavily since the accident.
You advise him that he should not be alone while he is in crisis. He contacts his sister who is happy for
him to stay for a week with her. You recommend that he takes a week off work and does not drive. You
give him a sickness certificate. You advise him to reduce his smoking and drinking, pointing out that
the drinking will only exacerbate the sleeping problem. You give him seven temazepam 10mg tablets
to help him sleep and make an appointment to see him the following week. Over the following weeks,
you monitor for the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression or an anxiety disorder.
You listen as he describes his experience and encourage him to ventilate his feelings and discuss what
the event means to him.
54
You will need to set aside two or three longer consultations (e.g. 25 minutes) in the counselling
phase as you assess and define the problems. The other steps can usually be spread over about five
15 minute sessions. However, new problems may then need to be addressed. Most of the work
is done by the person (him or herself) at home.
Some steps that you might take in assisting a woman with structured problem solving are listed
below:
• Explain the approach described in Table 6-2 and give her a copy of it (Appendix 3).
• Help to clarify the problem. The problem should be formulated as a specific goal or need.
• Suggest other possible solutions.
• Remind her of her strengths and weaknesses.
• Ensure that she is realistically appraising the different possible solutions.
• Make sure that she does not rush into action.
• Help her break down the plan into discrete steps.
• Help her to check the effectiveness of the action taken and identify any remaining
problems.
An example of counselling and structured problem solving is given in Box 6-2.
Table 6-2: Structured problem solving
Use this chart to help solve problems that are causing you stress. If problems are not dealt with, they
often worsen and cause more stress.
1. Make a list of the things that are worrying you.
2. Choose the problem that you want to deal with first and write it down as a need or a goal (e.g. ‘I
need to find a job‘, rather than, ‘I don’t know what to do with myself’. Or, ‘I need to have more
money in the bank’, rather than, ‘I haven’t got enough money’).
3. Write down all the possible solutions you can think of. List all solutions, including bad or silly
ones. The aim at this stage is not to decide if a solution is good or bad. You might want to ask other
people whom you trust to suggest some other possible solutions.
4. Beside a list of the possible solutions, draw two columns and write in them the advantages and
disadvantages of each. Your GP or another person you trust may be able to help you with this.
5. Choose the best solution. It does not have to be the perfect solution. There rarely is such a thing.
But it is better to try some solution than to do nothing at all.
6. Write down the steps needed to carry it out. Include the things you need to do, the resources that
you require (e.g. a car or a day off work), the hurdles you need to overcome and the time you
anticipate that it will take. You may need to rehearse some of the steps (e.g. a difficult interview
or phone call). Decide on your goals so that after you have put the plan into action, you can assess
how well it worked. For example, the goal might be having more money in the bank, going out
with friends once a week or having fewer arguments with your spouse.
7. Put the plan into action.
8. Review how effective the solution was. First of all, congratulate yourself on trying to solve the
problem rather than doing nothing. What have you achieved? What problems remain? Should you
continue with the current solution, modify it or try a different approach?
9. Repeat the process for the remaining problems.
Note: When you are under severe stress, your ability to solve problems is often impaired. Avoid making
major life decisions in the midst of a crisis.
Crisis intervention, counselling and structured problem solving
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 55
Non-specific stress reduction techniques
In addition to the specific techniques discussed above, a number of non-specific techniques
can be used to reduce stress. People should be advised to avoid major life changes in the midst
of coping with major stressors. They should be reminded of the importance of dealing with
problems in their lives rather than ignoring them (e.g. ongoing relationship problems). They
may benefit from the controlled breathing, relaxation exercises and self-hypnosis described in
Appendices 4, 5 and 6. It may be useful for them to monitor their daily activities and to use a
Daily Activity Schedule that includes enjoyable activities and a regular exercise program (see
Appendix 7). Advice on avoiding self-medication with alcohol, cigarettes and benzodiazepines
and improving sleep habit may also be indicated (see Table 14-3). It may be appropriate to
refer people to other specialist agencies that can help with their problems (e.g. for financial
counselling).
A note on advice
Rather than help people solve problems themselves, it is often tempting to tell them how to
solve their problems. It may save time in the consultation and the ‘solution’ may seem obvious.
However, you should resist this impulse. Telling a man what he should do will reinforce his
sense of ineffectiveness and low self-esteem. Since it is the man himself who has to live with the
consequences of his actions, he should take responsibility for these decisions himself. If you tell
him what to do, he will be less committed to the decision and may blame you if things do not
work out well.
Box 6-2: Example of counselling and problem solving
A 47-year-old man recently diagnosed with angina has been advised to have a coronary artery bypass
graft. He has always been a capable sportsman and has prided himself on his physical strength and
agility. He is upset and angry about how the illness will limit his activities. Since being given the
diagnosis, he has increased his cigarette and alcohol consumption. His only significant past medical
problem was a fractured hip that he suffered in a motorbike accident when he was in his twenties. He
was counselled for depression during the rehabilitation from this injury.
He initially states that he is not going to have the operation, but instead intends to give up his job,
leave home and travel Australia on a motorbike. You advise him not to make hasty decisions while he
is in crisis. You listen to him and empathise with his frustration and sense of loss. You remind him of
the damage he is doing with his smoking and excessive drinking. You observe him carefully over the
following months for the development of depression.
He later consents to the operation, but he remains angry and despondent about his circumstances.
Amongst the specific problems that he identifies is his inability to continue playing competition
squash. His problem solving goal is to find alternative activities. His list of possible solutions includes:
•	stopping all sporting activity
•	aiming to play less physically demanding sports
•	 carrying on playing squash, regardless of the consequences.
After considering the adverse consequences of giving up all sport (boredom, few other interests and
loss of social contacts) and the dangers of continuing playing squash, he chooses the second option.
He lists the steps as follows:
•	 completing the cardiac rehabilitation course
•	asking a friend to nominate him for membership of the local bowls club
•	 enrolling in golf lessons
•	asking a friend to nominate him for a position on the sports club committee.
Three months later, he is still engaged in the cardiac rehabilitation. He gave up playing bowls because
he did not enjoy the game, but he has joined a golf club and his game is quickly improving. He is
treasurer of the sports club. There have been strains on his marriage. You listen as he describes these
problems and use a similar approach to help him to deal with them.
56
There are exceptions to this rule. As an expert in medicine, you will give advice on the diagnosis,
treatment and prevention of illness. During the crisis intervention phase, when a person’s
judgement is severely impaired and his or her ability to cope is overwhelmed, it may be necessary
to take control and advise him or her what to do. In particular, it is often wise to advise people
who are in the midst of a crisis not to make major life decisions. You should also advise people
what to do in situations in which there is danger to themselves or others.
Structured problem solving aims to help people find solutions to their
problems themselves. It is not about telling people what they should do.
Patients often see doctors as authorities, not only on medicine, but on many other matters as
well. This attitude may be a manifestation of a paternal or maternal transference. It is flattering
to be regarded this way by our patients, but generally inadvisable to act out in the countertransference by telling people how they should run their lives. Some examples of appropriate
and inappropriate advice are given in Box 6-3.
A note on ‘debriefing’
Note that ‘debriefing’ or crisis intervention alone is ineffective in preventing later psychological
sequelae following a traumatic event. While those who are exposed to trauma have a high risk
of later developing a psychiatric disorder, most who do so do not suffer an acute stress reaction
at the time of the event. The key is in long-term observation and early intervention. General
practitioners are well placed to do this.
Box 6-3: Giving advice
Appropriate advice
• A woman consults you two days after her husband has left her. She is thinking of selling her house
and moving interstate. You advise her to delay making such a major decision until the immediate
crisis has settled and the advantages and disadvantages of it can be calmly and carefully considered.
• A woman tells you that her husband, who has delusions that she is being unfaithful, has threatened
violence against her. You advise her to take the threat seriously and to call the police if there is any
immediate threat of violence. You explain how he can get access to treatment. You also explain the
legal protection available (protection or restraining order) and how to access safe houses through
Crisis Care.
Inappropriate advice
• An elderly woman who was widowed two years ago and whose children live overseas
often asks you for advice on how she should manage her affairs. One day she asks if you
think she should sell her house and move to a home unit. Coincidently, you recently
decided to invest in the float of a public company that is soon to be privatised. You
advise her to sell the house, move to a unit and invest her excess capital in the company.
Comment – In the transference, she speaks to you as she might have spoken to her husband or
her son. In the counter transference, you make the mistake of acting as if you were her husband
or son. The appropriate response would have been to use the structured problem solving approach
outlined above. Amongst possible solutions, you would ask what her son suggests she should do.

Grief counselling
In the last chapter, I discussed the principles of counselling and structured problem solving.
Here, I describe the application of these principles to two specific situations that are common in
general practice—counselling the bereaved and giving people bad news. Both involve helping
people deal with grief, the response of a person to loss. Bereavement, physical and mental illness,
redundancy, unemployment, relationship breakdowns and other stressful life events involve
significant losses, including a loss of the ability to carry out valued activities, and losses of earning
capacity and independence.
Whereas grief refers to the individual’s response to loss, mourning is the process that people go
through after a loss. It involves a number of tasks as discussed below. The general practitioner
should avoid pathologising what is a normal mourning process. On the other hand, he or she
needs to recognise and intervene when the mourning process is abnormal, or when a person
develops a mental disorder.
Whereas grief refers to the individual’s response to loss, mourning is a process
involving a number of tasks.
Bereavement
Normal grief
Normal grief may involve a variety of feelings, thoughts, behaviours and physical symptoms.
Some of these are listed in Table 7-1.
Tasks of mourning
Worden1 describes the following four tasks of mourning:
1. Accepting the reality of the loss
While it is normal for the bereaved to exhibit some denial of the loss, it is abnormal for the denial
to persist. Denial may be manifest in a number of ways. The room of the deceased may be left as
it was at the time or his or her death. The bereaved may lay out his or her clothes each morning.
Alternatively, all reminders of the deceased may be removed from the house. These behaviours will
cease when the reality of the loss is accepted.
2. Experiencing the pain of grief
Every individual experiences grief in his or her own way, and no individual will experience
all of the symptoms and signs listed in Table 7-1. However, in the process of mourning,
every individual needs to experience the pain of grief. Grief is often complicated when the
relationship with the deceased was characterised by marked ambivalence: the person may
feel guilty that they had often wished ill of the deceased. An inability to acknowledge anger
with the deceased may result in the anger being displaced onto other family members or
yourself.

Table 7-1: Feelings, thoughts and behaviour associated with normal grief
Feelings
• shock and numbness – This commonly occurs immediately after the death and is accompanied by
feelings of disbelief.
• sadness
• anger – For example, a man may feel angry with his wife for abandoning her. The developmental
origins of the anger of the bereaved can be seen in the protest that a child exhibits when separated
from his or her caregiver. The anger may also be understood as an expression of the person’s
frustration in being unable to prevent the loss.
• guilt – People often feel guilty that at the time of the person’s death, they had not done something
to save him or her.
• anxiety – The bereaved may fear that they will not be able to cope without the deceased. They may
have a heightened awareness of their own mortality.
• loneliness
• yearning – The person longs to be reunited with the deceased.
• relief – People in difficult relationships may experience some relief on the death of their partner.
When the deceased suffered a long and distressing death the bereaved may be relieved that his or
her suffering is over. There may be also be relief when the deceased suffered a long and burdensome
illness such as dementia.
Thoughts
• disbelief – This is a common response on hearing of the death.
• poor concentration – The person is preoccupied and distracted.
• preoccupation with the deceased – The person is constantly thinking of the deceased.
• hallucinations – The person may see images of the deceased, especially early in the mourning
process.
Behaviour
• sighing and crying
• vegetative function change – People who are grieving may suffer some transient sleep and appetite
disturbance. Their concentration may be impaired and they may be absent-minded. (Persistent
neurovegetative symptoms suggest a diagnosis of major depression).
• interpersonal withdrawal – The person may withdraw from social contacts.
• dreams of deceased
• reminders of the deceased – Some people may avoid reminders of the deceased, while others
become particularly attached to photographs, clothes, jewellery and other mementos of him or
her. They may visit places of special significance to the deceased.
• searching – They may call out the name of the deceased and search for them.
• activity level – Some people become withdrawn and inactive while others may be restless and
overactive.
• culturally specific responses – In Anglo-Saxon cultures, there is generally less emotional display
than in southern European cultures. In an Irish wake the bereaved eat and drink, and talk about
good and bad memories of the deceased. In traditional Maori cultures, the body is viewed in an
open casket in the home of the bereaved. In the Kaluki tribe in New Guinea, feelings of sadness
and anger are combined with a feeling that compensation is due for the loss. In Iran, there is often
a display of righteous anger, and an identification with the families of religious martyrs1
.
Physical symptoms
• hollowness or churning in the stomach
• tightness in the chest or throat
• depersonalisation
• breathlessness
• weakness and fatigue
• sensitivity to noise; inability to block out background noise

3. Adjusting to a world without the deceased
The nature of the adjustment will depend on the role that the deceased played in the
person’s life. For example, a young widow may have to get used to coming home to an
empty house and caring for the children on her own. These issues often come to the fore
at around three months after the death. At this time, social supports have often fallen away
and the person is facing the task of getting on with life without the deceased.
4. Withdrawing from the deceased and forming new intimate relationships
The final task is to detach from the deceased and to form a new intimate relationship
without feeling that the memory of the deceased is in some way being dishonoured.
Four tasks of mourning include accepting the reality of the loss, experiencing
the pain of grief, adjusting to a world without the deceased, and withdrawing
from the deceased and forming new relationships.
The completion of these tasks of mourning usually takes at least a year after the death of a loved
one, and sometimes between three and four years.
Abnormal grief
Grief is abnormal when it is chronic, delayed, exaggerated or masked.
1. Chronic grief – The normal mourning process following the bereavement of a loved one
commonly lasts at least a year. When it persists too long, the person is likely to present for
help or be brought to see you by the family.
2. Delayed grief – A delayed grief reaction occurs when a person has been unable to complete
the tasks of mourning following the death, and instead suffers intense feelings of grief some
time later.
3. Exaggerated grief – Grief may be exaggerated when the experiences cause intense suffering
or become symptomatic of a mental disorder.
4. Masked grief – Rather than present with the normal feelings associated with grief, people
may react by developing persistent physical symptoms. These sometimes mirror the symptoms
suffered by the deceased. In other cases, the pain may symbolise the grief.
Factors predisposing to abnormal grief reactions
Some characteristics of the bereaved, his or her relationship with the deceased, the manner of
the loss and the person’s social milieu that may predispose to an abnormal grief reaction are
shown in Table 7-2.
Signs of abnormal grief
Some signs of abnormal grief are shown in Table 7-3.
Grief and depression
The distinction between the two is not always clear. The list of the symptoms of normal grief
demonstrates the overlap between the two syndromes. A diagnosis of depression is made when
the symptoms are prolonged and more severe than would be expected. Features that suggest
a diagnosis of depression include severe and prolonged feelings of worthlessness and low selfesteem, suicidal ideation, pervasive feelings of guilt that do not merely relate to the immediate
circumstances of the death, prolonged and severe psychomotor agitation or retardation,
hopelessness, panic attacks and other anxiety symptoms, and psychotic symptoms. The depressed
person typically suffers prolonged disability and handicap.

Grief counselling and therapy
The tasks of mourning are usually accomplished by people on their own with the support of
their friends and families. Nevertheless some will turn to you for help at these times, especially
those who lack close social supports. In other cases, you will recognise some of the signs of
an abnormal grief reaction or the onset of a mental disorder that has been precipitated by the
loss.
Table 7-2: Predisposing factors to abnormal grief
The relationship
Those in ambivalent relationships may have difficulty acknowledging their negative feelings about the
loss, especially anger and guilt. The person who saw the bereaved as a narcissistic extension of him or
herself will experience a painful sense of personal loss. The person in a dependent relationship will feel
helpless and abandoned.
The nature of the loss
Those who are bereaved by suicide often suffer shame because of the social stigma, guilt that they had
not done something to prevent the suicide, anger at the rejection and the burden that he or she must
now live with, and fear that he or she or someone else in the family will commit suicide.
Past history
The person with past complicated grief reactions or episodes of depression is at risk.
Personality factors
The obsessional person may have difficulty working through the pain of grief and dealing with the loss
of control. The narcissistic person who avoids being dependent on others may have difficulty dealing
with the pain of grief. The dependent person may be overwhelmed with feelings of helplessness.
Social factors
People who perceive that they lack social supports, or whose social supports deny or cannot discuss
the loss (e.g after suicide) may also be at higher risk. Those who experience other significant life events
around the time of the death may have difficulty working through the tasks of mourning.
Table 7-3: Signs of abnormal grief
• The person, long after the event, is unable to speak of the loss without experiencing fresh painful
feelings.
• The person over-reacts to minor triggers, such as watching a movie.
• The person fails to remove the possessions of the deceased. For example, the widow who, two years
after her husband’s death, still lays his clothes out for him every morning.
• The person avoids memories of the deceased. For example, the bereaved may not have attended the
funeral or have visited the grave.
• The person presents to you with physical symptoms identical to those suffered by the deceased.
• The person continues to suffer considerable disability and handicap for longer than a year after the
death.
• Themes of loss constantly crop up in the person’s conversation.
Grief counselling
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 61
Worden makes a distinction between grief counselling, which involves helping the bereaved
accomplish the tasks of grief, and grief therapy, which uses specialised techniques to help people
with complicated or abnormal grief reactions1
. For the sake of brevity, I discuss the techniques
of both counselling and therapy together.
Education
People will often be relieved simply to know that their experience of grief is neither abnormal
nor evidence of a mental illness.
Assisting people to accomplish the four tasks of mourning
1. Techniques used to help a person confront the reality of the loss include talking in detail
about the events surrounding the person’s death and about his or her relationship with the
deceased. You might ask the person to bring in mementos of the deceased and discuss their
meaning.
Talking in detail about the events surrounding the death and the person’s
relationship with the deceased helps the bereaved accept the reality of the loss.
2. People often have difficulty dealing with anger and guilt associated with grief. Anger is
especially prominent when the bereaved was very dependent on the deceased. The person
feels anger at his or her abandonment. Explore the nature of the relationship. Encourage
them to express their feelings. Help the person problem-solve new ways of coping. Anger is
also prominent when there is someone to blame for the death, for example after a vehicle
accident.
People often have difficulty dealing with anger and guilt associated with grief.
People whose relationship with the deceased was markedly ambivalent often experience
painful guilt during their bereavement. At times, they may even have wished the person
dead. Help them acknowledge their ambivalent feelings about the deceased. Talk about the
death and the person’s relationship with the deceased. Encourage the expression of negative
affects. Explain that it is normal to have negative as well as positive feelings about people,
and that to express one’s anger with the person does not diminish the positive feelings one
has. A specific technique is to encourage the person to talk about the things they miss, and
then the things that they do not miss about the deceased.
In some cases, people feel guilty that they were unable to prevent the death. The person will
usually come to realise that, in reality, there was nothing that he or she could do. In cases
where there is some real reason for the guilt, it is a question of the person acknowledging
what they did or did not do. In some cases, they may benefit from addressing the dead
person and apologising for their actions. You might ask the person to address the deceased
as if they were in the room. This can be facilitated by asking the person to imagine that the
deceased is seated in an empty chair.
3. Use structured problem solving to help the person cope with the practical challenges of
living without the deceased (see Chapter 6).
4. Encourage the person to form new relationships.
Anniversary reactions
Grief may recur at specific times after the death—at three months, when the practical challenges
of coping without the deceased are becoming evident; on anniversaries and birthdays; and at
holiday times.
1
 Worden JW. Grief Counselling and Grief Therapy. London: Tavistock Publication, 1983.
62
Maladaptive coping
Take note of any maladaptive ways of coping, such as excessive alcohol consumption or cigarette
use.
Reassurance
Avoid bland reassurance (see Chapter 2).
Physical examination
Be aware of the physical symptoms that are a feature of normal grief, but do not disregard the
possibility of physical illness.
Medication
A short course of a benzodiazepine may be indicated for insomnia early in the period of
mourning. Antidepressants should not be prescribed unless the process is clearly abnormal and
the diagnosis of major depression is made.
Effect on the family system
Consider the bereavement not only in terms of the individual who presents to you, but from the
perspective of the family as a whole (see Chapter 5).
Transference and countertransference
Feelings that the bereaved holds for the deceased may be displaced onto the therapist. These
include anger at being abandoned and guilt at the bereaved person’s inability to prevent the
death. Within the countertransference you will experience a number of painful feelings—the
frustration and helplessness of not being able to cure the person with a terminal illness; the pain
of witnessing the suffering of others; the response to negative feelings being displaced onto you
by the bereaved. Dealing with losses of others will activate feelings about your own losses and
feared losses. You will reflect on your own mortality. You are most vulnerable in the countertransference when the patient is similar to you or shares similar experiences. It is important to
recognise your own grief when a patient dies. In some cases, attending the funeral may assist
your own mourning.
Grief counselling and therapy often uncover strong transference and countertransference responses.
Worden recommends that those who provide grief counselling should take a personal loss
inventory. It is important to be aware of one’s own limitations and not take on too many patients
suffering bereavement. Recognise the sorts of people that you have difficulty dealing with and
refer them on. Dealing with death and dying is an exhausting process and can lead to burnout
(see Chapter 25). Recognise your own limitations and find out where you can get help if you
need it.
Breaking bad news
General practitioners often face the difficult task of breaking bad news. You may have to tell a
man that he has a chronic or terminal illness. You may have to inform relatives and friends of the
death of a loved one. The following six steps for breaking bad news are from Buckman’s book1
.
1. Timing and place
Wherever possible, bad news should be communicated in person rather than over the phone.
If the person has a poor command of English, arrange for a professional interpreter to be
present (see Chapter 4). Never use a family member as an interpreter when conveying bad news.
Sufficient time should be set aside and interruptions avoided. Find a quiet and private place. If

University Press, 1992.
Grief counselling
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 63
there are others with the patient, ask to be introduced and check with the person whether they
are to stay— ‘Is it OK if I talk freely about your illness while Gary is here?’ Begin the interview
with an open question, such as ‘How are you feeling?’
2. Find out how much the person knows
Clarify how much the person knows about the illness, its seriousness and the prognosis. Find out
how he or she has coped with illness and loss in the past. Note not only the content of what he
or she says, but also the language he or she uses. Observe how the person is feeling. Note his or
her specific concerns.
3. Ask how much the person wants to know
This will be the essential guide to how detailed the information you give should be. You should
check how the person is responding throughout the interview. You might say, ‘I’m not sure how
much detail you want me to go into. Are you the kind of person who likes to know all about
their problem or would you rather have just a broad outline?’
4. Provide information
First, clarify the person’s agenda. What are his or her main concerns? Throughout the interview,
you will try to align your understanding of the illness, its treatment and prognosis with that of
the patient. Early in the interview, it is often useful to signal that you have bad news to impart—
‘I’m afraid the situation is more serious than we thought’. Information should be provided in
small chunks and you should stop frequently to check that it has been understood. Use plain
English and avoid medical jargon. Let the person’s use of language guide yours. Reinforce and
clarify what you are saying.
5. Acknowledge and respond to the person’s reactions
People react to bad news in a variety of ways (see Table 7-4). In order to respond effectively, first
evaluate the acceptability and adaptiveness of the reaction and whether or not change is feasible.
Consider also whether the person is suffering a mental disorder.

Fear
Anxiety
Anger
Guilt
Despair

Bargaining
Humour

Threats

Flattery
Dependency
Acceptability
Be tolerant of the person’s reactions. In some cases, the person may be angry or even violent.
Try to remain calm. Acknowledge the emotion rather than argue the point at issue—‘You are
very upset with this news…’. Set limits—‘I want to discuss this with you, but it is difficult while
you are pacing the room’.
Maladaptive versus adaptive
Assess whether a response is adaptive or maladaptive. A degree of denial is almost always present
at some stage of the response. It is adaptive in protecting the person from being completely
overwhelmed by the news. On the other hand, it is maladaptive if it prevents a person receiving
64
appropriate treatment or otherwise interferes with his or her ability to cope with the illness.
The man who devotes his time to finding a cure for the condition from which he suffers may
feel more hopeful, and others may also benefit from his activities. However, the response is
maladaptive if it leads him to decline appropriate treatment or if it exhausts him, increases his
distress or isolates him from his family and friends.
Denial may be adaptive or maladaptive.
Changeable versus unchangeable
In spite of being maladaptive, some responses are simply not amenable to change. Rather than
exhaust yourself and the patient going over the same ground, it is sometimes better to accept
that the behaviour will continue, and to provide support. For example, if a person insists on
frequent changes of medication with little apparent benefit, it may be best to set aside a certain
amount of time at each consultation to listen to the complaints and empathise with his or her
anxiety. If you are not sure whether or not a problem can be fixed, refer the patient for a second
opinion.
Diagnose psychiatric illness
Around 20 per cent of people with cancer or other serious illnesses develop depression. While
there is some overlap between the normal responses to loss and depression, a diagnosis of
depression is made if the lowered mood is persistent, the symptoms severe and specific symptoms
of depression are present (anhedonia, marked vegetative function change that cannot be accounted
for by the physical illness, suicidality, psychomotor agitation or retardation, psychosis, prolonged
guilt, worthlessness and low self-esteem). If you are not sure, seek a psychiatric opinion.
The following communication techniques are useful when explaining bad news to people.
Some of these were discussed in Chapter 2.
Listening
Listen and allow the person to ventilate his or her thoughts and feelings.
Open-ended questions
Rather than respond directly to a statement of the patient—‘It can’t be true.’ ‘Well, I’m afraid it
is.’—it is often better first to deepen your understanding of the way the person feels—‘How are
you feeling now? What is running through your head at the moment?’
Empathic responses
Rather than respond in a literal way to the content of what a person says, it is often better to
respond first to the emotion behind the statement—‘It must be hard to believe you have this
illness, especially when you have always been so fit. You feel angry that this was not picked up
earlier’.
Open-ended and empathic responses are generally more effective than direct or
literal responses.
Avoid false reassurance
As mentioned in Chapter 2, reassurance has its place. For example, you may allay a man’s fears
byreassuring him that you can provide pain relief for his symptoms. However, there may be
times when, in an attempt to alleviate a man’s immediate distress you are tempted to mislead
him. When subsequent events do not go as you predict, the distress will be so much the worse.
Answering difficult questions
‘How long have I got?’ First, clarify exactly what the person means. He or she may not be asking
how long before they die, but, for example, how long before they leave hospital. Ask what they
understand their prognosis to be. Give the person a ballpark figure—‘It will probably be from
two to three months to five or six months’. Acknowledge your uncertainty and empathise with
Grief counselling
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 65
the anxiety that this uncertainty causes.
‘Is it terminal?’ Check what the person means. Ask a man what he understands the prognosis
to be. A statement along the following lines may be helpful—‘I have one patient with the same
condition who is still doing well and has had no recurrence after three years’.
Transference and countertransference
Be aware of the transference and countertransference. Communicating bad news is difficult and
often painful. Telling a person that they have an incurable illness acknowledges the limitations of
medical knowledge. Doctors may have particular difficulty with this task. One of the motivations
for entering the medical profession may be a heightened fear of death. You may feel guilty that
you neglected something that might have altered the course of the illness. You may resent having
to be the messenger of bad news, and the target of the anger and blame that often fall on the
messenger. Breaking bad news may not have been included in your medical training.
You may also have to deal with difficult transference responses, including flattery and dependency.
It is easy to be flattered when a man says that you are the best doctor he has ever had. However,
you may regret this later when you struggle to meet the special expectations the person places
upon you. It is best to articulate and correct the perception at the beginning—‘It is nice of you
to say that, but, really, this drug is very effective’. It is normal for people in distress and under
threat to be more dependent. However, it is important not to begin making decisions for the
person that are outside your area of expertise and should really be made by that individual,
perhaps with advice from his or her or relatives.
Transference responses to receiving bad news include idealisation of the
therapist and excessive dependency upon him or her.
6. Planning
At the end of the interview, summarise your understanding of the illness, the treatment and the
prognosis, and the specific concerns raised by the patient. Give the person time to ask questions.
Make a time for the next appointment.

Supportive psychotherapy
For some people with chronic mental disorders, the ability to cope with life challenges is not
just temporarily overwhelmed in the face of life stressors, but rather it is chronically impaired.
Supportive psychotherapy is indicated for this group of people. Despite the fact that it is a
form of therapy that is widely used by psychiatrists, general practitioners and other health
professionals, research into it has, until recently, been relatively limited1
.
Background
Definition
Supportive psychotherapy is a form of long-term psychotherapy that aims to optimise patients’
functioning, promote their autonomy, enhance their self-esteem, and lessen their anxiety and
distress. Unlike other forms of therapy, supportive psychotherapy does not aim to produce major
change in the person. While behavioural treatments aim to alter the way people act, cognitive
therapy the way people think, and dynamic therapy the patterns of their defences, supportive
psychotherapy aims not to change, but rather to strengthen their existing coping mechanisms.
Supportive psychotherapy is a form of long-term psychotherapy that aims to
optimise a person’s functioning by strengthening rather than changing his or
her existing coping style.
Indications
Supportive psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for people with chronic disabling conditions
in whom fundamental personality change is not a realistic goal. These people are often severely
handicapped, with a limited range of interests and activities, and impoverished social worlds.
They are often isolated and what relationships they have are often fraught with conflict. Their
ability to cope with the everyday challenges of life is limited and they have few social and other
resources to assist them. Included are people with chronic psychotic disorders (schizophrenia,
delusional disorder), severe affective disorders (chronic depression, bipolar disorder), anxiety
disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder), somatoform disorders (chronic pain, hypochondriasis,
somatisation disorder) and personality disorders. However, not all people with these diagnoses
require long-term supportive therapy, Many are able to cope well despite their illnesses, and have
strong social supports.
Supportive psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for people with chronic
disabling conditions in whom fundamental personality change is not a realistic
goal.
Aims
In view of the severe disability and handicap suffered by these people, the goals of treatment are
modest. In some cases, merely maintaining the person’s level of functioning is the appropriate

 Bloch S. Supportive psychotherapy. In: Bloch S, Ed An Introduction to the Psychotherapies. 3rd ed. Oxford:

68
goal. The overall aim is to optimise the patients’ adaptation to living. Specific aims are to optimise
their social and occupational functioning, to help them deal as adaptively as possible with life
challenges, to acknowledge and cope with their losses, to boost their self-esteem, to improve
their reality testing, to monitor their mental states and prevent relapse of their illnesses, to
support their families and other carers, to provide a source of comfort and security, to promote
their autonomy, and eventually to transfer support from therapy on to the individual’s family and
other people in their social milieu.
Treatment setting
Unlike the other therapies described in this book, supportive psychotherapy is not time limited
but rather long-term. In general practice, sessions will usually be between 15 and 25 minutes.
Regular appointments should be made, usually at two or four weekly intervals. You will need to
discuss your own availability out of hours and arrange whom the person should contact in an
emergency. Where possible, you will speak to family members and other carers. You will need to
liaise with other agencies involved in the person’s care that may include the local mental health
service, employment and housing agencies, and patient and carer support groups.
Techniques of therapy
A number of methods discussed elsewhere in this book are applicable. Basic interview skills
are required—taking a history, listening, clarifying, allowing the expression of feelings, asking
directive psychological questions, using an empathic style, and responding to verbal and nonverbal
cues (see Chapter 2). Most important is the ability to listen to the patient, to clarify what he or
she says, and to be alert to any significant change, whether for better or for worse.
Basic interview skills are important in supportive psychotherapy—history
taking, listening, clarifying, allowing the expression of feelings, asking directive
psychological question, using an empathic style, and responding to verbal and
non-verbal cues.
Be aware too of the non-specific aspects of the interview that contribute to the efficacy of
therapy: the intense, confiding relationship; the setting in your surgery; the acknowledgment
of your credentials as a ‘healer’; your ability to instil hope; your provision of new information;
the person’s emotional arousal in discussing personal events; and his or her experience of
improvements in symptoms and functioning1
.
At different times in therapy you will use crisis intervention and structured problem solving to
deal with acute stressors. Various behavioural techniques may also be indicated—for example,
the use of activity schedules and programs of exposure for the treatment of phobias. Many
people will be on drug treatments for their mental disorder. The following techniques are used
in supportive psychotherapy. Care needs to be taken in their use. I give examples of their
appropriate and inappropriate use.
Holding and containment
The ability of the therapist to be there for the person provides a point of stability and security
in his or her otherwise chaotic world. The comfort these people have in knowing that you are
there for them can soothe them when they are under stress. In facing a difficult situation, a
person may imagine what you might do before he or she acts.

1972; 6:34-40.
Supportive psychotherapy
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 69
Often in therapy, the best intervention is to listen and do nothing rather than to do something
that is ineffective or even destructive. On the other hand, it is important to recognise
when a dysfunctional, though stable situation has changed and requires active intervention
(see Box 8-1).
Genuineness
In comparison with other forms of psychotherapy, part of the role of the therapist in supportive
psychotherapy is to be a model for the patient. Some minimal self-disclosure may even be
appropriate. For example, you should give matter-of-fact answers to questions about where
you are going on leave. You may give some acknowledgment that your life is not as perfect and
ideal as he or she assumes. You may share a joke. On the other hand, it is quite inappropriate to
discuss specific aspects of your life or your personal problems. This blurring of boundaries will
only confuse the person over your role as a professional or a friend, as helper or helped (see Box
8-2).
Reassurance
The role of reassurance in therapy was discussed in Chapter 2. Reassurance is used more
frequently in supportive psychotherapy than in most other forms of psychotherapy. Make sure
that the reassuring statement is true and not merely a bland platitude (see Box 8-3).
Box 8-1: Holding and containment
A 38 year-old woman with chronic schizophrenia complains of ongoing problems in the relationship
with her defacto partner. There are no safety issues, but repeated attempts to ameliorate the difficulties
through couple counselling have been ineffective in producing change. Nevertheless, the relationship
has survived. There have been no recent changes in her mental state. You anticipate that she will
continue to discuss these problems with you from time to time. You observe for any significant changes.
At the same time, you accept that while there are likely to be continuing difficulties in the relationship,
it is presently in a state of equilibrium.
Caveat
A 45 year-old woman suffers from chronic schizophrenia. She is of borderline intelligence and
demonstrates histrionic and obsessional personality traits. There have been long-term difficulties in the
relationship with her husband who also suffers from schizophrenia. The conflicts have usually arisen
in the context of her need to be in control and to keep their house tidy, while her husband remains
unconcerned about these matters and is not always willing to help. She has been more upset over the
past three months. She has been sleeping poorly and has lost the energy to do the housework. She takes
a minor overdose of temazepam. At this point, it is essential to realise that the situation has changed.
She is suffering major depression and requires treatment for it.
Box 8-2: Genuineness
A person says to you, ‘Being a doctor and with all your money, you wouldn’t have any problems’.
Without being specific, you can assure the person that you face problems in your life too.
Caveat
You do not take this further and begin ventilating your financial problems to the person.
70
Positive reframing
Even adverse events may have some positive aspect (see Box 8-4).
Explanation
Education of the person and the family about his or her illness is an essential component of
treatment. People with severe disorders may have distorted perceptions of reality that adversely
affect their judgement and behaviour. Clarification and explanation of the reality of a situation
will help them meet challenges in more adaptive ways (see Box 8-5)
Box 8-3: Reassurance
• A man had a panic attack while waiting in line to buy tickets for a concert. He was convinced
he was having a heart attack. After taking a history, examining him and performing the necessary
investigations, you are able to reassure him that there is no evidence of any heart problems, but that
his symptoms are typical of a panic attack. You then explain the treatment of panic attacks.
• A young man with schizophrenia is upset after someone remarks that the job he does in the family
fruit and vegetable shop is too easy. He feels he is letting his family down by not contributing more.
You ask his mother to come into the consultation. She states that the family is very pleased with his
work. Although his duties are somewhat less demanding than those of the others employed in the
shop, they recognise his disabilities and note that he has only had one day off work in the last six
months when he had the flu. You remind him that many young men of his age, without a disability,
have difficulty finding work. Moreover, many with his disabilities do not work at all.
Caveat
A man with post-traumatic stress disorder complains of disturbing nightmares, often relating to his
experience in Vietnam. He wakes around four times every night. Calculating that he nevertheless does
get, on average, six hours sleep, you attempt to reassure him that his sleep is quite adequate. He fails to
turn up for his next appointment.
Box 8-4: Positive reframing
A young man with schizophrenia is upset after attending the wedding of an old school friend. He does
not have a girlfriend and is aware of how his illness limits his options in life. While acknowledging the
man’s grief, you add that there may nevertheless be some benefits of suffering the illness. While most
of his friends probably have little understanding of what it is like to suffer a chronic illness, mental
or physical, he is learning about this at an early age. He can use this knowledge to his advantage by
looking after his physical health. At some stage his friends will develop some illness, something that
will be new and hard for them to cope with when they are in their middle-age or older.
Caveat
This must be done sensitively. The statement you make must be true and should not be presented in a
way that fails to acknowledge the reality of the losses that he suffers.
Supportive psychotherapy
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 71
Advice
The use and misuse of advice were discussed in Chapter 6. Because of the person’s limited
coping skills, you will give advice more frequently in supportive psychotherapy than in other
forms of psychotherapy. You will give advice about treatment of the illness and when and how
to seek help; about every day problems such as budgeting, diet, good sleep habit and general
self-care; and on social and interpersonal skills—for example, being assertive or how to behave
on social occasions (see Box 8-6).
Suggestion
Whereas advice involves giving a person explicit instructions about what to do in a particular
situation, suggestion seeks to modify a person’s behaviour by showing or withholding approval
for their actions (see Box 8-7).
Box 8-5: Explanation
• You explain to a young woman with schizophrenia and her family about the illness, its symptoms,
suspected causes, treatment and prognosis. You make yourself available to answer questions and you
refer the parents to the family education program at the local mental health service, and the young
woman to the patient education program.
• A man with schizophrenia has long standing delusions that he has been chosen by God to perform
some important act, the nature of which is not clear to him. He is often frustrated that others do
not share his conviction. You acknowledge that you must agree to disagree about the nature of his
beliefs. You believe that they are a symptom of his illness. You nevertheless respect the reality of
these experiences and their importance to him. You seek common ground in aiming to optimise
his work, leisure and social functioning.
Caveat
In telling a man that he suffers from early dementia, you do not offer unsolicited comments about
the worst case outcomes. Nor do you argue strongly about the doubtful scientific efficacy of an
inexpensive herbal treatment that he has faith in. Instead you are guided by his questioning (see also
Chapter 7). The relatives and family may want more explicit information.
Box 8-6: Advice
In treating a young man with schizophrenia, you offer advice on a number of matters in addition to
the treatment of his illness. You suggest that he arranges a direct debit from his bank to pay his rent
each pension day. You provide him with dietary advice to help prevent excessive weight gain while
he is taking antipsychotic medication. When he asks for a prescription for temazepam to help him
sleep, you point out that, because he sometimes sleeps 15 hours a night, it is expected that he will have
difficulty falling asleep the following night. You advise him to get up at a regular time every morning.
You recommend that rather than attempt to return directly to full-time work, it might be better to
first seek some part-time work. You suggest that he could meet some people with similar problems at
Schizophrenia Fellowship.
Caveat
A woman has numerous complaints about her husband. Unless there are compelling reasons that she
is at risk—for example, if he is violent—it would be quite inappropriate for you to advise her to leave
him. She must make such decisions herself.
72
Encouragement
By making encouraging statements about a person’s actions you enhance his or her self-esteem,
reduce his or her sense of ineffectiveness and promote further positive actions. Like reassurance,
encouragement must be genuine and realistic if it is to be beneficial. It is important to stay alert
to the possibility of change and progress. In view of the long-term nature of therapy and the low
expectations of change, there is always the danger of missing or ignoring changes when they do
occur (see Box 8-8).
Transference and countertransference
While being informed by the transference, you will generally not interpret it in supportive
psychotherapy. It is essential to monitor your countertransference. Because all of the techniques
discussed here can have adverse as well as beneficial consequences, you need to be clear about
whether an intervention is truly to help the patient or is instead an acting out of your own
frustration, boredom, rescue fantasy or other feeling or impulse (see Box 8-9).
Box 8-7: Suggestion
The defacto partner of a young woman has assaulted her in the past. Last week when he came in an
intoxicated state to visit, she refused to let him in. You congratulate her on her self-assertion.
Caveat
You take care not to collude with a young man as he laughs about his criminal activity.
Box 8-8: Encouragement
• When a man with schizophrenia tells you of his plans to spend two weeks in New Zealand with a
friend, you congratulate him on his initiative. You ask him to describe the plans in detail and offer
any commonsense suggestions. You check that he has a plan for getting help if he needs it. On
his return you ask about the trip and congratulate him on doing something so challenging. Later,
at times when his confidence is low, you remind him how well he managed on the trip to New
Zealand.
• You make a polite comment about a person’s appearance—‘That new hairstyle suits you’.
Caveat
A young woman with borderline personality disorder who has not worked for five years intends to
return to full-time work. You congratulate her on her initiative, but remind her that she might be
better off trying some part-time work initially.
Box 8-9: Transference
• A man with severe post-traumatic stress disorder is angry when you are 20 minutes late for his
appointment. You recognise his resentment and explain why you were running late.
• You are seeing a 28-year-old woman who has a five-year history of severe disorganised schizophrenia.
She first presented during her first year at medical school. You take care to set realistic goals for
her treatment and rehabilitation. Otherwise, your identification with her may lead you to entertain
unrealistic fantasies about what she can achieve that in the long-run may only lead to disappointment
for her and frustration and burnout for you.
Caveat
You might understand the rage of a woman with borderline personality disorder as a reflection of her
identification with her stepfather who abused her as a child. However, an interpretation along these
lines is only likely to make her more upset.
Supportive psychotherapy
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 73
Interpreting defences
Though the interpretation of defences does not play a major role in supportive psychotherapy,
there are times when it is useful to clarify how a person feels, and to discuss maladaptive ways
that he or she responds to events. A useful technique is to ask a (man) to reflect back on how
he reacted to a stressful event, after the event has passed and he is calm—‘Strike while the iron
is cold’.1
Remember that the ego defences are deployed as a solution to problems. Removing them will,
at least initially, lead to an increase in anxiety. In the face of unavoidable external stressors (for
example, suffering a severe and chronic illness), some degree of denial is often adaptive (see Box
8-10).
Improving social supports
The techniques of interpersonal psychotherapy are applicable here (see Chapter 1). High levels
of expressed emotion in the families of people with mental health problems may exacerbate
their conditions. On the other hand, strong social supports improve a person’s prognosis and
limit his or her disability and handicap (see Box 8-11).
Catharsis
Within a trusting therapeutic relationship, a person may be able to reveal events in their lives that
they have been unable to discuss with anyone else (see Box 8-12).
Box 8-10: Interpreting defences
A middle-aged man states that he has been depressed since taking redundancy from his job two years
before. After describing the circumstances of the loss of his job, you are able to clarify that, in addition
to feeling depressed at his loss, he is also angry with his former employer and ashamed at his reduced
ability to provide for his family.
Caveat
A 46-year-old woman with schizophrenia is upset and contemplating suicide after repeated
arguments with her daughter. After her daughter is diagnosed and treated for post-natal depression,
her distress subsides. You are then able to discuss and clarify the cause of her upset.
Box 8-11: Improving social supports
The course of a young man’s schizophrenic illness is complicated by substance abuse. His parents are
frustrated at their difficulty getting help and they make written complaints about the care offered by
yourself and the local mental health service. You spend several sessions with the parents explaining the
facts of the illness and the substance abuse, and answering their questions. You empathise with their
feelings of helplessness and attempt to address any shortcomings in his previous management. You
discuss, in a matter-of-fact way, the limitations on what you can do, especially about the substance
abuse. You later find that the parents remain the young man’s principal supports. They are more readily
able to accept the limitations of what they can do, as well as the limitations of what you can do.
Caveat
A young man with chronic schizophrenia has little social contact outside his immediate family. He is,
nevertheless, satisfied with this, as are his parents. While you remind him of the availability of various
social activities, you do not press him too hard to engage in these.

74
Techniques of supportive psychotherapy include holding and containment,
genuineness, reassurance, positive reframing, explanation, advice, suggestion,
encouragement, monitoring the transference and countertransference,
interpreting defences, improving social supports and allowing catharsis.
Problems in supportive psychotherapy
All of the techniques described above present dialectical dilemmas in their application:
how actively to intervene; when and how much to self-disclose, deciding whether or not a
reassuring statement is true, how comprehensive an explanation should be; whether to ignore or
confront a person’s denial; when to give advice what is appropriate encouragement; how actively
to embark on a plan of rehabilitation; deciding the appropriate goals of rehabilitation; when it
is useful to promote an emotional catharsis versus when to move on; and deciding whether an
intervention is for the sake of the patient or to satisfy an impulse of your own.
It is difficult to strike the right balance between providing support to the person while not
promoting excessive dependence. Given these patients’ levels of disability, some degree of
dependency is inevitable. On the other hand, promoting excessive reliance on your guidance
may cause the person to regress and act in less adaptive ways. An excessively directive approach
may reinforce a person’s feelings of helplessness and further compromise his or her ability to
act autonomously. Since the people who are offered supportive psychotherapy often have great
difficulty in personal relationships, maintaining a therapeutic alliance with these people is often
difficult.
Moreover, the limited gains made over long periods of time can be demoralising and frustrating
for the therapist. It is essential to monitor your countertransference to prevent acting out in
the therapy. It is probably wise to limit the number of severely disabled people that you take
on. Countertransference problems are best addressed in supervision and through peer support
groups.
In comparison with other forms of therapy, the therapist in supportive psychotherapy reveals
more of him or herself to the patient, at times even providing some minimal self-disclosure. It
is a constant challenge deciding what, when and how much to self-disclose. Are you disclosing
for your own purposes or for the good of the patient? Be careful not to blur the professional
boundaries between therapist and patient. Remember that the relationship is different from a
friendship. There is not the same expectation of mutuality, since the therapist is there for the
patient and not vice versa. A failure to clarify the boundaries will confuse the person and may
lead him or her to make excessive demands upon you. Other boundaries may also be breached
more easily in supportive psychotherapy. For example, although you will always try to involve
family and carers in treatment, you must still respect the person’s right of confidentiality.
Box 8-12: Catharsis
After seeing a man for several years for treatment of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, he weeps as
he confides that while serving in Vietnam, he had an illegitimate child whom he has been supporting
over the past 25 years.
Caveat
While respecting a young woman’s need to discuss her past sexual abuse, you nevertheless focus on
helping her deal more effectively with her current problems.
Supportive psychotherapy
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 75
Finally, there is a danger that in providing support, you may inadvertently perpetuate problems
by maintaining equilibrium in a system that removes the impetus for a person to change. For
example, regular visits to a therapist may prevent a person from doing something about his or
her relationship problems.
Beware that therapy is not perpetuating problems by maintaining an
equilibrium that removes the impetus for the person to change.
77
Behavioural treatments
Behavioural techniques derive from learning theory, which holds that both adaptive and
maladaptive behaviours are learned through our interaction with the environment. Three models
of learning are described—classical conditioning, operant conditioning and social learning. A
brief overview of behavioural treatments follows together with a case example.
Classical conditioning (associative learning)
Pavlov performed the classic experiment. A dog salivates when presented with food. A bell is
then sounded each time the dog is offered food. After several repetitions, the dog salivates on
hearing the bell, even in the absence of any food. The bell has become a conditioned stimulus
to produce a response mediated by the dog’s autonomic nervous system. The response becomes
attenuated if the bell continues to be rung while not paired with the presentation of food.
Watson performed a similar experiment on an infant referred to as ‘Albert B’. Albert began the
experiment playing happily with a white mouse. A frightening stimulus (a loud noise) was then
applied whenever Albert touched the mouse. After several repetitions of the experiment, the boy
became upset and fearful when presented with the mouse, even if no noise was made. Stimuli
similar to the mouse, for example a white rabbit, also distressed him—that is, the response
became generalised.
Two clinical examples of classical conditioning are shown in Box 9-1.
Classical conditioning helps us understand the origin of phobias and the cues
to anxiety and other affective states.
Operant conditioning
Operant conditioning explains how the frequency of a behaviour is increased or decreased.
Positive reinforcement
Skinner performed the following experiment. He placed a rat in a cage in which there was
a lever that, when pressed, released a pellet of food. Initially, the rat only pushed the lever by
chance. Then, as it learned the consequences of its action, the frequency at which it pushed the
lever increased. Eventually, the rat was pushing the lever most of the time, even when it could
not eat any more pellets. The pellet of food positively reinforced pushing the lever.
Negative reinforcement
Another experiment involved a rat receiving an electric shock whenever it went to one end of
its cage. It quickly learnt to escape by running to the other end and staying there. In this case,
Chapter 9
Box 9-1: Classical conditioning
• A young boy is bailed up by the neighbour’s Alsatian dog. Over the following weeks, he becomes
upset and starts crying whenever he sees the dog. Later he becomes frightened even of small dogs
and other domestic animals (generalisation).
• A Vietnam veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder has a panic attack while watching
a news item on a battle in Kosovo. Images of battle have become a cue to re-living the anxiety of
his combat experience.
relief from an aversive stimulus (the electric shock) is a negative reinforcer of the avoidance
behaviour.
Punishment
Finally, the frequency of a particular behaviour can be reduced if an aversive stimulus or
punishment follows the behaviour. In contrast to negative reinforcement, which increases the
frequency of a behaviour (avoidance), punishment reduces its frequency.
Examples of operant conditioning are shown in Box 9-2.
Operant conditioning explains how the frequency of a behaviour is increased or
decreased.
Social learning
Bandura noted that we also learn by observing the behaviour of others and its consequences for
them. For example, we learn to speak through imitation of our parents (see clinical example in
Box 9-3).
Social learning explains how new behaviours can be learned by observing
others.
Behavioural approaches to treatment
In the following sections, I outline the approaches to behavioural assessment, treatment and
outcome evaluation. I then provide a case example.
Behavioural assessment
A behavioural assessment begins by operationalising the problem behaviour—that is, by
describing the behaviour in a measurable and specific way. The second step is to explore what
happened before and after the behaviour in order to identify any reinforcers. The third stage is
to set the goals of treatment.
Behavioural assessment involves operationalising the target behaviour, clarifying
its antecedents and consequents, and setting the goals of treatment.
Box 9-2: Operant conditioning
•	 Positive reinforcement
Adam is the eight-year-old only son of a young professional couple. He sees little of them during
the day, and they are usually too tired to spend much time with him when they get home. In
response to the tantrums he has been having over the past month, both parents stop whatever
they are doing and turn their attention to trying to placate him. The tantrums are becoming more
frequent and lasting longer.
•	 Negative reinforcement
Joyce had a panic attack at the supermarket three weeks ago. She ran out of the building, leaving her
shopping behind, and she has not returned there since. The relief from anxiety negatively reinforces
her avoidance behaviour.
Box 9-3: Social learning
During treatment for her needle phobia, Tracey was able to observe her older sister having an injection
without getting upset, and then being congratulated by her mother and the doctor.
Treatment
Some behavioural treatment techniques are listed below.
1. Counselling and problem solving (see Chapter 6 and Appendix 3)
2. Methods of arousal reduction – These include controlled breathing, progressive muscular
relaxation and self-hypnosis. They are described in the handouts for patients in Appendices
4, 5 and 6.
3. Daily activity schedules (see Appendix 7) – By becoming more active, a person regains access
to sources of positive reinforcement. Documenting pleasurable activities will correct the
depressed person’s perception that he or she is unable to gain any pleasure or satisfaction
from life activities. A daily activity schedule can be used to document baseline functioning
and the progress of treatment.
It is often useful to suggest that patients incorporate some pleasurable activities, exercise,
duties or chores, and social activities in their day. They can then document the actual activities
and rate their responses to them using the schedule.
4. Exposure – This involves the construction of a hierarchy of feared situations that the person
then confronts in order from least fearful to most fearful. The person may first confront his
or her fears in imagination before doing so in vivo. It is explained in the patient handout
in Appendix 8. The person must stay in the feared situation: if she or he escapes, the relief
from anxiety negatively reinforces the avoidance behaviour. Changes in the person’s level of
anxiety can be documented using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), (see Figure
9-1).
The person can document how the level of anxiety falls when he or she stays in the situation
(habituation), (see Figure 9-2). In order to maximise the efficacy of the treatment, patients
should not be prescribed a benzodiazepine and should not take any safety devices with them
such as mobile phones. The efficacy of the treatment depends on the person confronting his
or her anxiety.
By rating the peak level of anxiety experienced at each exposure, the person can also
document the lessening of anxiety on each occasion (desensitisation), (see Figure 9-3).
To promote desensitisation, the person should confront the feared situations regularly and
frequently.
5. Exposure and response prevention – This is the treatment of choice for the rituals of obsessive–
compulsive disorder. The person is asked to confront his or her fears (exposure) without
performing the ritual (response prevention). Instead of using the ritual to decrease the
anxiety, the person is asked to wait until his or her anxiety subsides through habituation. For
example, a woman with obsessional fears of contamination may be asked to touch a door
handle and then go about her usual activities without washing her hands. The person is then
asked to work through a hierarchy of feared situations as described above.
6. Goal setting – Goal setting is an important part of rehabilitation for chronic mental disorders.
The first step is to engage the person in the process of change, discussing the pros and cons of
staying the same or moving on. The next step is to identify problem areas and to reformulate
these as needs: for example, a man’s problem of being bored might be reformulated as, ‘I
need to become involved in some interesting activities.’ A list is then made of his strengths
and other resources, including any specific talents (e.g. sporting or musical ability), people
who will help, specific interests and past interests. Goals are then set that use the resources
available to meet his needs. It is essential that the goals are realistic: if they are too difficult,
the man may only be setting himself up for failure. On the other hand, they should be a
challenge to him. A goal also needs to be formulated in a specific operationalised form. For
example, rather than, ‘Going to the movies,’ it could be, ‘Going to see Titanic on Wednesday
night at the Hyperdome with Richard.’ Long-term goals need to be broken down into small
steps. For example, the goal of returning to work might involve an occupational therapy
assessment, referral to a job support agency, preparation of a resume, commencing work
eight hours a day, then building up over a period of months. Progress should be monitored.
People are praised for the goals they fully or partially attain. The assessment of progress
determines the next step to be taken.
Outcome evaluation
The SPHERE-GP1 is a useful tool for assessing the outcomes of treatment (see Appendix 1).

Case example
Behavioural assessment – operationalised account
Jane presents to you after suffering a panic attack in a cinema. She begins by saying, ‘I felt
terrible’. After further questioning, the operationalised account of what happened might be as
follows: ‘I was convinced that I was going to die. My heart was racing and I felt as if I was going
to pass out. My fingers were tingling and I was gasping for air because I felt as if I was choking’.
A careful history and mental state examination excludes an additional diagnosis of depression.

Behavioural assessment – antecedents and consequents of the behaviour
Jane states that she has been very worried about various financial problems over the past six
months. She has been ruminating over them and sometimes feels she will never get on top of
them. Last Friday night, she went alone to see a movie, hoping to take her mind off her other
worries. Twenty minutes into the movie, she had the panic attack.
During the panic attack she felt that she had to get out of the theatre. Once outside, she felt
better. She drove quickly home, buying a packet of cigarettes on the way. She smoked 10 of them
and also drank three glasses of wine before going to bed.
Behavioural assessment – setting the goals of treatment
Jane and her therapist settle on the following three goals:
1. to develop a plan to deal with her financial problems and to avoid maladaptive patterns of
coping such as substance abuse
2. to learn to understand her anxiety symptoms and to control them
3. to be able to go to a movie on her own.
Counselling and structured problem solving to deal with financial problems
Counselling begins by clearly defining the problem—her income versus her recurrent costs of
living and her debts. Various options are explored: sending back the furniture that she is buying
on lay-by; re-financing the loan to pay off her car (or selling the car); reducing her cigarette
consumption; getting a part-time job in the evening. Having discussed the pros and cons of each
possible solution, she chooses a plan of action. She writes down each step that she needs to take
to implement the plan. The plan is then put into action. Later, its effectiveness is assessed and
changes made where necessary.
Treating the anxiety symptoms
The therapist explains the nature of anxiety; its physical, psychological and behavioural
manifestations; the fight and flight response; the relationship between anxiety and performance;
and the causes of anxiety.
She is then taught a method of arousal reduction (progressive muscular relaxation) and a
breathing control technique. She is encouraged to practice these every day. As well as becoming
more proficient in their use, the practice also enables her to experience what it feels like to be
relaxed. The breathing control is also used to abort the onset of a panic attack.
A cognitive approach is also used (see Chapter 10). She is asked to keep a diary of the dysfunctional
thoughts that she has at times when she is feeling anxious. One entry from this diary is shown
in Box 9-4.

Treating the avoidance behaviour
Graded exposure is used to attain the third goal—going to the cinema. First, Jane is taught about
the theory of exposure. She is told that escaping from the cinema will only worsen the problem,
because the avoidance is rewarded by a fall in anxiety. Therefore, she should only expose herself to
situations that she is confident she can tolerate. If she stays in a feared situation, her anxiety level
will fall. She can prove this by documenting her level of anxiety during exposure (habituation).
Each time she enters a particular feared situation, she will experience a little less fear than she
did the time before (desensitisation).
She is asked to construct a hierarchy of feared situations from least feared to most feared. She
rates the amount of anxiety that she expects to experience at each step on a scale from 0 to 100
where 0 means no anxiety and 100 is maximal anxiety (see Box 9-5).

Having assured herself that she will be able to manage the first step, she puts it into action. As
part of her homework, she rates the peak anxiety level during each exposure. When this has
fallen to around 50 per cent of the predicted anxiety level, she is ready to proceed to the next
step. She will notice that her anxiety levels are lower on each repetition of a step.
Documenting the outcomes of treatment
The SPHERE1 instrument is used to assess her condition before, during and on completion of
the treatment.
Training in behavioural treatments
While many of the techniques described in this chapter may seem straightforward, a common
reason for failure of therapy is a haphazard approach to treatment. For example, exposure of a
person with agoraphobia to a situation that he or she cannot tolerate will only reinforce his or
her avoidance behaviour. If you do not have enough time to perform these techniques, refer
the person to a specialist in the area, such as a clinical psychologist. If you are interested in using
the more complex techniques, it is advisable to have training and supervision from a specialist
in the area.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
This type of psychotherapy has proven effectiveness in the treatment of mild and moderate
depression, panic disorder, agoraphobia, eating disorders and personality disorders. Its basic
premise is that disturbed mood is caused by distorted, negative and maladaptive thinking.
Disturbed mood, in turn, produces negative ways of thinking. CBT seeks to improve mood
by identifying and challenging negative thoughts and replacing them with more realistic and
adaptive ones. Useful references include the books by Hawton et al.1
 and DeRubeis2
. Self-help
books include those by Tanner and Ball3
, Burns4
 and Beck and Greenberg5
.
CBT is based on the premise that disturbed mood is caused by distorted,
negative and maladaptive thinking.
The cognitive model described by Aaron Beck puts forward three concepts to explain the origin
of depression:
a) the cognitive triad
b) schemas
c) cognitive errors
In reading this chapter, you may recognise a number of techniques that you already use. If so,
I hope that the discussion helps you organise your interventions and encourages you to seek
further training in CBT.
Background
The cognitive triad
The cognitive triad comprises three patterns of thinking that depressed people habitually use. First,
a depressed man tends to have a negative view of himself, attributing any negative experiences he
has to a fault within himself. Second, he tends to interpret his ongoing experiences in a negative
way. He sees the world as making impossible demands upon him, obstacles are constantly being
put in his path, and he is constantly being frustrated from realising his goals. Third, he has a
negative view of the future, anticipating that his suffering will only worsen and that he will
never attain his goals.
People with depression have negative views of themselves, the world and the
future.

Schemas/underlying assumptions/core beliefs
Schemas are relatively stable patterns of thinking that a person habitually uses to interpret his or
her experiences. As he or she becomes more depressed, these primitive depressive schemas come
to dominate his or her thinking more and more, while other more balanced ways of evaluating
events recede. These negative schemas become increasingly independent of events until in severe
depression they can become autonomous, with the person unresponsive, or even oblivious, to
external events.
Cognitive errors
People who are depressed make cognitive errors in processing information about their experience.
Treatment involves identifying their automatic thoughts, recognising the logical errors in them
and replacing them with rational responses to the events. Note, however, that CBT is not
just about thinking positively, or eliminating unpleasant feelings altogether. Rather, it is about
appraising events realistically. Some common cognitive errors are listed in Box 10-1.
CBT aims to uncover the cognitive errors that people make in evaluating events
in their lives and to help them make more rational evaluations.
Treatment techniques
Introduction to therapy
Since the person is an active collaborator in cognitive behavioural treatments, he or she must
first understand and be engaged in the process. He or she may wish to read one of the self-help
texts mentioned above. A course of CBT usually requires at least eight weekly sessions, each of
about 25 minutes duration.
Box 10-1: Common errors in thinking
Mind reading – ‘She thinks I’m a fool.’ or ‘They think I’m a bore.’
Fortune telling – ‘I’m sure to make a fool of myself.’ or ‘I’m sure to mess it up.’
Black and white thinking – Things are seen as either all good or all bad. ‘That is awful.’ or ‘I’ve totally
messed it up.’ or ‘Unlike me, he always gets things right.’
Labelling – saying ‘I am’ instead of ‘I did’—‘I’m an idiot.’ or ‘I’m a failure.’ instead of ‘I did not win the
competition.’
Overgeneralising – saying ‘always’, ‘never’, ‘no-one’ or ‘everyone’—‘I will never pass the exam.’ or ‘Noone cares about me.’
Expecting too much of yourself – saying ‘should’, ‘must’ or ‘have to’, and so setting unrealistically high
standards for yourself—‘I must do this perfectly.’
Refusing to accept praise – ‘He is only saying that because…’ or ‘It was only a fluke that…’
Over-emphasising failure – ‘Now I’ll never be able to do it.’ or ‘What’s the point of trying again.’ or ‘They
will never accept me now.’
Personalisation – blaming yourself for things over which you have no control—‘Where did I go wrong
that he could do that?’
Emotional reasoning – ‘I don’t feel like doing it.’ or ‘Maybe I’ll feel like doing it tomorrow.’
Not considering the possibilities – saying ‘I can’t.’ instead of ‘How can I…?’
Living in the past – ‘If only I had…’
Focusing on the negative – Because of one negative aspect of an event, you assume that it is all bad. ‘He
ignored me, so I must be a bore.’
Over the first week of treatment, it is useful to ask patients to make a record of their activities
and their associated moods. They may rate their moods on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 is
the worst possible and 100 is the best. Simply identifying his or her moods may begin to give a
person a sense of control over them. The record may later be used to provide evidence to correct
cognitive distortions. For example, a man who says he is depressed all the time will realise that,
in fact, he is only depressed at certain times of the week. The record also provides the starting
point for increasing the range and scope of daily activities.
Early in therapy, patients are asked to make a record of their activities and the
associated moods.
Three-column technique
The next step is to ask people to record their automatic thoughts at times when they are
experiencing unpleasant feelings. One way to do this is to ask them to draw three columns
on a piece of paper. In the first column, they record the situation in which the unpleasant
feeling arose. In the second column, they describe the feeling. In the third column, they record
their automatic thoughts. People may often be unaware of their internal dialogue. The ability
to reflect on and monitor their thoughts often provides, in itself, a sense of self-efficacy and
emotional relief.
The thoughts that need to be recorded are those that reflect on the personal meaning of the
event for that individual (e.g. ‘I’m a failure.’). A thought may be an inference about what the
event means for the person’s future (e.g. ‘I will never get a job.’). It may reflect on how other
people will perceive them (e.g. ‘Everybody will think that I am a failure.’). Not all automatic
thoughts are negative. Moreover, some negative thoughts are realistic and appropriate to the
circumstances (e.g. a man feels guilty after swearing at his wife. He thinks, ‘I should not have
done that. I must apologise and do my best not to do it again.’). Thoughts that are descriptions of
mood should be recorded in the feelings column (e.g. ‘I feel sad.’). Thoughts that are descriptions
of the event should be recorded in the situation column (e.g. ‘I did not get the job.’). What needs
to be recorded are the actual thoughts the person had at the time, not a description of them
(e.g. ‘I will never be able to do this’, rather than ‘It was terrible. I didn’t know what to say.’). The
handout in Appendix 9 will help explain this to patients.
Five-column technique
A next step is for patients to complete a daily record of dysfunctional thoughts. They are asked to
draw five columns on a piece of paper. In the first column, they record the situation in which an
unpleasant emotion was experienced. In the second column, they describe their mood and rate
its intensity. In the third column, they record the automatic thoughts that accompany the mood.
The strength of belief in these thoughts is rated on a scale of 0 to 100. In the fourth column,
they note the cognitive distortion in the automatic thought and write a rational response to
it. Patients should be reminded that some unpleasant thoughts are reasonable and contain no
cognitive distortion. The aim is to appraise events accurately, not simply to ‘think positively’. The
ability to correctly classify cognitive distortions is less important than the ability to recognise and
challenge them. The following questions are helpful for finding rational responses to automatic
thoughts:
1. What is the evidence for and against the belief?
2. What are alternative interpretations of the event or situation?
3. What are the real implications, if the belief is correct?
4. What would you say to a friend who said that?
5. What is the worst thing that could happen if it were true?
6. How likely is this ‘worst case’?
7. How would you deal with this ‘worst case’ if it were true?
8. If the ‘worst case’ came to pass, how would you feel about it tomorrow, next week, next
month, in a year, in five years, in ten years?
9. All things considered, how likely is the thought to be true?
Patients also rate the strength of their belief in the response. On completion of the exercise, they
complete a repeat rating of their mood and their belief in the automatic thought. An example
of a typical entry using the five-column technique is shown in Box 10-2.
The five-column technique is used to document unpleasant mood states, the
situations in which they arise, the automatic thoughts that accompany them,
the cognitive distortions implicit in the automatic thoughts, rational responses
to them, and the outcome of the process.

It is important to distinguish between simple descriptions of how one feels (e.g. ‘I feel guilty.’ or
‘I feel ashamed.’ or ‘I feel terrible.’) from thoughts about the meaning of one’s experiences (e.g.
‘I feel guilty, because I should have been able to stop him drinking.’ or ‘Because I did not win
the race, I am a failure.’). It is only the latter that can be challenged. Statements about how one
feels are irrefutable. Descriptions of how one feels should be recorded in the mood column.
Challenging the way people say they feel is unempathic and will only damage the therapeutic
alliance.
Only thoughts about the meaning of events can be questioned; descriptions of
how one feels cannot be refuted.
Later in therapy, the patient may use a simplified version, the two-column technique, which
focuses on the automatic thoughts and rational responses. Box 10-3 demonstrates this twocolumn technique and contains examples of the cognitive distortions.
Vertical arrow technique
The vertical arrow technique illustrated in Box 10-4 can be used to dig deeper and uncover a
person’s schemata—the assumptions that underlie his or her automatic thoughts. One technique
is to write down the automatic thought and then ask the following questions:
• What if that did happen?
• What would this mean to me if it were true?
• What is so bad about that?
• What do I mean by that?
The vertical arrow technique is used to elucidate underlying assumptions that
may predispose a person to depression.
A useful tool for uncovering these schemata is the Dysfunctional Attitudes Schedule1
. Some of
the dysfunctional attitudes that may predispose to depression are shown in Table 10-1.
Burns2 suggests a number of variants of this approach in challenging some underlying
assumptions:
1. List the advantages and disadvantages of the assumptions.
2. Compare the predicted satisfaction gained from a particular activity with the actual satisfaction
recorded after completing the activity. For example, a woman with underlying assumptions
about the need for love and approval may discover that she gains just as much satisfaction
from solitary activities as from activities that involve others. The man who is addicted to
achievement may find that he gets a lot of enjoyment from activities outside work.
3. For the perfectionist, Burns3 suggests recording satisfaction with an activity together with a
measure of how effectively (percentage of perfection) it was done. people often find that the
two are not as closely related as they had assumed.
Table 10-1: Underlying assumptions that predispose to depression
• ‘I can only feel good if she approves of what I do.’ – People whose self-esteem is based on how
others judge them are vulnerable to depression and anxiety.
• ‘I cannot do without her.’ – Those whose self-esteem depends on being loved by someone are
vulnerable to depression and anxiety.
• ‘I must be the best at work.’– An excessive reliance on productivity and achievement at work
predisposes to the development of depression and anxiety.
• ‘I must be perfect.’ – Only being satisfied if things are done perfectly leads to anxiety and
disappointment.
• ‘I am entitled to success, love and happiness.’ – The belief that you deserve success, love and happiness
leads to depression and frustration when things do not all go your way.
• ‘It is my fault that he did it.’ – People who assume that they are responsible for everything that
happens in their world are prone to guilt, blaming themselves for things over which they have no
control.

Automatic thought Cognitive distortion and rational response
She says nothing when I
enter the room. Therefore, she
dislikes me.
(mind reading)
The fact that she says nothing does not mean she dislikes me. She
may be listening to someone else. She may prefer to speak to me
later.
I think he is wrong, but I won’t
say anything, because I’m sure
to make a fool of myself.
(fortune telling)
I think he is wrong and I have good reasons for my view. I will tell
him.
He ignores what I am saying,
so I must be boring.
(focusing on the negative)
While it appears that he is ignoring me, others are listening
attentively. I am certainly not boring them.
I missed out on getting the
job. Therefore, I will never get
a job.
(over-generalisation)
While it is disappointing that I did not get this job, it does not
mean that I will never get another job. I have a good work record
and I have always managed to find work before, even when jobs
have been scarce.
I have made a mistake.
Therefore, I will be sacked.
(over-emphasising failure)
Everybody makes mistakes. I can learn from this and do better
next time. The problem is easily fixed, so there is no reason for me
to be sacked.
The boss complimented me,
but he probably just felt sorry
for me.
(refusing to accept praise)
I did do a good job and it deserves to be recognised.
I didn’t vacuum the floor today.
Therefore, the house is filthy.
(black and white thinking)
The fact that the floor has not been vacuumed today does not
make the whole house filthy. Most of my friends only vacuum
once a week. Others often remark on how clean the house is.
I do not feel like seeing
anyone, so I’ll just stay home.
(emotional reasoning)
Just because I feel like staying home does not mean that I should
do so. Since I have an appointment with the hairdresser and I do
need to have my hair cut, I should keep the appointment.
I should always please my boss. (expecting too much of yourself)
I cannot please her all the time. Even if I do everything well, there
is no guarantee that she will be pleased. I will, however, continue
to work well.
He should be more
considerate.
(expecting too much of others)
It would be nice if he were more considerate. If I treat him well,
he might be more considerate, but I cannot guarantee it.
I did not get into the A Team. I
am a failure.
(labelling)
While I did not make the team, I still enjoy indoor cricket, I have
a good job and a happy marriage, and I enjoy good health.
If only I had worked harder, I
would now have a better job.
(living in the past)
There are opportunities for promotion in the Company. I will
discuss this with my supervisor.
I can’t play tennis. (not considering the possibilities)
I could get some coaching and play well enough to join the club.
My son has been found
smoking marijuana. Therefore,
I am a failure as a mother.
(personalisation).I cannot be monitoring his activities 24-hours a
day. He is 18 years old and responsible for himself. What I can do is
1) provide him with the facts about the dangers of the drug, and 2)
insist he not smoke at home.

My academic record is good and, in any case, I passed.
I have had successes in a number of areas of my life,
including my academic career, so I am not a failure.
Because I should have got an ‘A’.

Why do I always have to get ‘A’s?
(expecting too much of yourself)
A ‘C’ is still a satisfactory pass.
Because otherwise my unblemished
academic record will be ruined.
↓
Why does it matter if my academic
record is not perfect?
(black and white thinking)
I do not have to be perfect at everything that I do. I will
only make myself anxious attempting always to be perfect.
The important thing is my training for the job, not my
academic record, which, in any case, is rarely taken into
account in job interviews.
Because people will think that I am
slipping and have no respect for my
work.
↓
If people do not respect my work, why
would I be upset?
(mind reading, focusing on the negative)
In fact, most people are not very interested in my work.
My previously ‘unblemished’ record is as much to blame
as my ‘C’. It is what I think about myself, not what others
think about me, that is important.
People would look down on me and
see me as a failure.
↓
If people saw me as a failure, why
would this upset me?
(mind reading, focusing on the negative)
Why should they look down on me? It is still a very good
academic record. I am happily married. I am well liked by
my friends at the club.
Nobody would want to know me.
↓
Why would this be a problem?
(mind reading, focusing on the negative)
I have several friends outside of work who would not
care about my exam results. They might like me better
knowing I’m not always ‘perfect’.
Then I would be alone.
↓
Why would this be a problem?
(black and white thinking)
I would still have my family and friends.
Because life would not be worth living
if I were alone.
(black and white thinking)
I get a lot of pleasure out of activities that I do alone, e.g.
painting, reading and my stamp collection.
Behavioural techniques
An inability to act is common among depressed people. Since they are unable to solve their
problems, their difficulties tend to escalate and they lose access to sources of positive reinforcement.
A number of techniques can be used to assist problem solving and to help people become more
active:
1. Counselling and structured problem solving (see Chapter 6)
2. Daily activity schedule (see Appendix 7) – Plan each day’s activities hour by hour. The
person begins each day by reviewing the activities he or she actually undertook the day
before. The advantage of having a schedule is that it removes the need to make a decision
about what to do on the day. If the person fails to implement the schedule, the reasons can
be explored using the cognitive techniques described above.
3. List the advantages and disadvantages of a particular action, or of doing nothing.
4. Test negative hypotheses. For example, a man who believes that he can only get pleasure
doing things with other people could test this by listing the activities for the day, rating the
pleasure expected to be experienced doing each, and then reviewing the actual pleasure
experienced on completion of each activity. Contrary to expectations, people often find that
they got as much, if not more, pleasure from solitary activities than from doing things with
others.
5. Break complex tasks down into a series of steps.
6. For people who have difficulty motivating themselves to act, it may be useful to list the
thoughts that oppose action and then rebut them with thoughts that promote action.
7. Others are often telling people who are unable to act that they must do something. This
may only exacerbate the problem, because being told what to do often removes the pleasure
in doing it. People often react to nagging by doing nothing. They may have to learn to do
things in spite of the fact that this may please those who are nagging them.
People sometimes have to do something, in spite of the fact that it is what
other people are nagging them to do.
Indications for cognitive behaviour therapy
Cognitive behaviour therapy is an effective form of treatment for people with mild to moderate
depression, anxiety disorders and eating disorders. While structured problem solving alone may
be indicated for people who are temporarily overwhelmed by their problems, CBT may be a
useful adjunct in the treatment of those who have often had difficulty solving their problems
in the past. CBT should be combined with antidepressant treatment in those with moderate or
severe depression and anxiety. CBT is likely to be more effective than IPT in the treatment of
people with few affectively charged precipitants to their depression, but less effective in people
with significant cognitive dysfunction.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 91
Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
This form of therapy was originally developed in the USA by Gerald Klerman and Myrna
Weissman for the acute treatment of outpatients with non-psychotic depression1, 2
. It has also
been used in the maintenance treatment of depression and in the treatment of a number of
specific populations of depressed people—adolescents, older people, HIV positive patients and
people with dysthymia,3 bipolar disorder4
 and bulimia nervosa.
Background
The principal assumption of IPT is that a person’s mood, and events in his or her interpersonal
world, are interdependent. Interpersonal events—both adverse and favourable—can lead to
depressive symptoms, and depression may, in turn, impair a person’s interpersonal functioning.
By actively intervening to improve a person’s interpersonal functioning, his or her mood will
also improve. The focus of treatment is on interpersonal problems in one of four areas: grief, role
disputes, role transitions or interpersonal deficits.
An assumption of interpersonal psychotherapy is that by improving a person’s
interpersonal functioning, his or her mood will also improve.
General characteristics
The therapy is time-limited. In the original descriptions by Klerman and Weissman, it is spread
over 12–16 weekly sessions each of 50 minutes duration. In this form, it is probably not suitable
for use in general practice. However, a shorter version comprising six half-hour sessions—
interpersonal counselling (IPC)—has been shown to be effective in primary care populations5
.
Comparison with other psychotherapies
Although IPT shares many characteristics with other forms of psychotherapy, it is distinguished
from these in a number of ways. Its unique feature is the interpersonal focus and, specifically, the
focus on one of the four problem areas. Moreover, the focus is on here and now functioning.
While information about past relationships, including childhood relationships is sought, this
information is only used to cast light on current interpersonal functioning. Unlike dynamic
and supportive therapies, it is time-limited, a characteristic it shares with CBT and behavioural
therapies. As in CBT, the therapist discusses cognitive distortions that may be contributing to
interpersonal difficulties. However, unlike CBT, the therapist does not specifically seek out
maladaptive patterns of thinking, nor does he or she set specific homework tasks (see Chapter 14

for a discussion of the relative indications for IPT versus CBT). While dynamic psychotherapy
may attempt to change a person’s personality, IPT does not set this as a goal. IPT, nevertheless,
recognises the influence of personality on the outcome of treatment, on the patient/therapist
relationship and on interpersonal functioning.
The conduct of IPT
The beginning phase (sessions 1–3)
In assessing a person for IPT, you need to diagnose the type of depression from which the person
suffers, perform a risk assessment, exclude possible medical causes of the symptoms and evaluate
the need for medication (see Chapter 14). Educate the person about the nature of depression
and its treatment. Explain that depression is a serious medical illness that is not uncommon;
that, like a physical illness, it is not the person’s fault; and that there are effective treatments that
enable depressed people to return to being their usual selves. Rate the severity of the person’s
depression using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D)1 and use the results as a
baseline for monitoring the person’s progress.
Admit the person to the sick role. Explain that depression is a medical illness that is often
attended by considerable disability and handicap. The person is, therefore, entitled to take some
time off his or her usual roles and responsibilities. This will help displace any guilt about having
the illness away from the person and onto the illness and the interpersonal problem. At the same
time, the person is expected to work with the therapist to get better.
In IPT, the person is explicitly given admission to the sick role.
Make an inventory of the person’s current interpersonal relationships and note how these are
linked to the onset of his or her depressive symptoms. Explore the nature and frequency of the
person’s interactions with others, the patterns of these relationships and any recurrent problems
in them. Within a given relationship, assess the expectations that the patient and the other
person have of each other and whether these expectations are being fulfilled. Discuss both the
positive and negative aspects of the relationship. Define changes that the person would like,
either through changes in his or her own, or the other person’s behaviour.
Identify one, or at most two, key problem areas: grief, role dispute, role transition or interpersonal
deficits. In interpersonal therapy, grief refers specifically to bereavement. Other losses, such as the
loss of a job or a relationship breakdown, are regarded as role transitions. Role transitions include
developmental changes (e.g. leaving home, getting married, dealing with ageing), relationship
changes (e.g. marriage or divorce), changes in role at work (e.g. promotion, redundancy,
retirement) and other significant life events (e.g. the birth of a child, moving house, illness of
the person or a family member). Role disputes involve conflict with another person—a spouse,
a family member, a colleague at work or some other significant figure in the person’s social
world. The category of interpersonal deficits is reserved for those who do not have evidence of
current problems in any of the other three categories. Many of these people have impoverished
social worlds and possess limited social skills. Some are involved in social relationships, but feel
dissatisfied with them. Others suffer from chronic depression.
Therapy concentrates on one (or at most two) of the four problem areas: grief,
role dispute, role transition or interpersonal deficits.

Psychology 1967; 6:278-296.
Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 93
People often present with problems in several of the key problem areas. Focus on the one that
best encapsulates the event that precipitated the depression. Present your formulation to the
person (see example in Box 11-1) and seek agreement on the focus of therapy.
Explain the concepts and process of IPT. He or she may wish to buy the patient’s guide to IPT1
Tell a (female) patient that IPT focuses on here and now issues, and that she will need to discuss
important events in her interpersonal world and describe her feelings about these. Reach an
agreement with her about the nature of the therapy and the number, frequency and duration
of the sessions.
People undergoing IPT need to understand and agree that therapy will focus
primarily on here and now issues—in particular, their relationships with
significant people in their lives—and that they will be expected to discuss
these relationships and their feelings about them.
Middle phase (sessions 4–12)
The middle sessions focus on the key interpersonal problem area. You should generally begin
sessions by asking an open-ended question about the past week and any significant events, such
as ‘How have you been since the last session? What has happened?’ Ask the person to describe
the events in detail, including the way he or she felt. Make links between the events and the
person’s mood.
In discussing an interpersonal conflict, it is often useful to ask, ‘What did you want?’ Ask a
(female) patient to consider other ways that she could have dealt with the situation. Explore the
positive and negative consequences of the different possibilities. She may benefit from rehearsing
more effective ways of coping. Complex tasks may be broken down into a series of more
manageable steps. Easy tasks are often best performed before more difficult ones.
Grief
The aim is to facilitate the mourning process, and to help the person move on and establish
new relationships and interests (see also Chapter 7). Grief is abnormal when symptoms are
excessively severe or persistent, or when they fail to appear. In the latter case, the person may
experience symptoms later, for example, on the anniversary of the death.
The goals of grief work are to facilitate the mourning process and to help the
person move on and develop new relationships and interests.
Review the depressive symptoms and their relationship to the death. The person with unresolved
grief often idealises the relationship with the deceased, while refusing to acknowledge anything
positive about events following the bereavement. Ask the person to describe both positive and
negative aspects of the relationship, and of the future without the deceased—‘What do you miss?
Box 11-1: Sample interpersonal formulation
You are suffering from major depression. This illness is not your fault. Effective treatments are available.
One of these is interpersonal psychotherapy, which is based on the idea that our feelings are linked to
events in our lives. It seems to me that you have been in conflict with your husband since the birth
of your daughter last year. Over the next 12 weeks, I suggest that we work on finding better ways of
coping with this dispute with your husband. This will also relieve your depression.

94
What don’t you miss?’ It is particularly important for the person to be able to acknowledge
negative aspects of the past relationship and to feel free to experience and express negative
affects associated with these. The process of mourning may be facilitated by having the person
go through the belongings of the deceased and other mementos such as photographs.
Ask the person to describe in detail the events surrounding the death. Exactly what was he or
she doing before, during and after the death? How did he or she feel? Encourage the person to
acknowledge both good and bad affects. For example, a man may feel guilty that he could do
nothing to save the person, or that he was not present at the moment of death. Was he able to
discuss his feelings after the funeral? Did he express his grief or did he cover it over?
Encourage the person to move on. Ask, ‘Where do you go from here?’ It may be relevant to
explore the implications of becoming a ‘professional mourner’—people sometimes believe that
if they stop grieving, the person will be forgotten. Promote the formation of new relationships
and participation in new activities.
Role dispute
The aim is to clarify the nature of the dispute and to modify expectations and faulty
communication in order to bring about a more adaptive resolution of it. The most appropriate
action to take will depend on the stage of the dispute. If there is open conflict, the participants
will need to calm down before the problems can be renegotiated. If the dispute has reached an
impasse (i.e. if communication about the problem has ceased, while an atmosphere of tension
and suppressed hostility remains), the level of overt conflict will rise as the issue is brought out
into the open. In some cases, the conflict may be irreconcilable with the only solution being to
dissolve the relationship. Here, the role of the therapist is to facilitate the mourning process and
then to encourage the formation of new relationships.
Role disputes may be at the stage of re-negotiation, impasse or dissolution.
The source of role disputes often lies in conflicting expectations of the two participants. For
example, a woman may wish to get a job and pay someone to take care of her children, while her
husband expects her to stay home and manage the household. Explore the patient’s expectations
and where they conflict with those of the other person. Do they reflect problems that the person
has had in other relationships? What is the person gaining from his or her behaviour? What
is perpetuating the conflict? Explore options for the resolution of incompatible expectations.
What can the person do to change his or her expectations? What can the other person be
expected to do?
The source of role disputes is often found in non-reciprocal expectations of the
two protagonists.
Depressed people often blame themselves for things over which they have no control, or for
failing to meet unreasonable expectations of others. Clarify these issues and, where applicable,
normalise forbidden affects: ‘If someone treats you like that, you have a right to feel angry.
You are entitled to expect things to change.’ The person may benefit from rehearsing more
assertive behaviour. It may be useful to ask the partner in a marital dispute to attend some of
the sessions.
Role transitions
The aims are to mourn the loss of the old role, to recognise positive aspects of the new role and
to restore self-esteem by developing a sense of mastery over the demands of the new role.
Begin by reviewing the depressive symptoms and linking them to the change in role. Giving up
an old role is a loss, which the person needs to mourn. Encourage the person to talk about the
loss and to express feelings associated with it, including negative feelings such as anger, frustration
and guilt. Review the positive and negative aspects of the new role. Even adverse events present

some positive opportunities. Encourage the person to take advantage of these opportunities.
Correct false assumptions that he or she has about the new role. Teach structured problem
solving to deal with the practical consequences of the role transition. Review opportunities that
the person has for making new social relationships.
Interpersonal deficits
The aims in treating people with these problems are to reduce their loneliness and social isolation,
and to encourage the formation of new relationships. Since these problems are often difficult and
long standing, the goals of therapy are modest—to start work on alleviating them, rather than
completely resolving them. Owing to the absence of significant current relationships, therapy
focuses on past relationships, the therapeutic relationship and forming new relationships.
People whose primary problems are interpersonal deficits are encouraged to
reduce their social isolation and to form new relationships.
Review the depressive symptoms and link them to the person’s social isolation. Clarify the
patterns of significant past relationships and note any recurring problems. Ask the person to
consider both positive and negative aspects of these relationships. Use the therapeutic relationship
as a model of how the person relates to others—that is, actively discuss the transference. Ask a
(female) patient to tell you if there is something you do that upsets her. Ask her to articulate her
feelings and discuss her concerns. Use the techniques of communication analysis and role-playing
discussed below. Encourage the person to put his or her newly learned skills into practice by
getting in touch with old friends, going out with new friends and attending social functions.
Termination phase (sessions 13–16)
The termination phase begins with a review of the gains that the person has made, the active
steps that he or she has taken to overcome the problems and the changes in the severity of
symptoms. The patient, not the therapist, is given credit for these gains. Educate the person
about the possibility of relapse. After a single episode of major depression, there is a 55 per cent
chance of relapse. After three or more episodes, there is a 90 per cent relapse rate. Ask the person
to reflect on his or her early symptoms of relapse, and to have a plan to seek help should these
symptoms arise.
In interpersonal therapy terms, termination constitutes a role transition. The person experiences
normal sadness, but not depression, at the ending of the relationship. Address the issue directly
and encourage the expressions of ideas and feelings about termination.
The person experiences the termination of therapy as a role transition.
For people who fail to respond to IPT, referral should be made for another form of treatment.
For those with recurrent depressive episodes, consider maintenance interpersonal therapy1
.
In the form in which it has been evaluated, this involves 50-minute sessions once a month.
If you embark on this treatment, a new contract should be made with the patient. Unlike
acute treatment, maintenance treatment may require switching the focus over the course of
treatment.

Techniques of therapy
Klerman and Weissman1 describe the following techniques as applicable (though not unique)
to IPT.
Directive and non-directive exploration
At the beginning of sessions, non-directive techniques are used to gather information. Ask
open-ended questions and use verbal and non-verbal communication to encourage the person
to continue what he or she is saying. You may repeat what the person has just said or refer back
to something said earlier. Later in the session, you may need to use more directive techniques.
For example, you might use closed questions to clarify the details of an interpersonal dispute.
Clarification
You might ask a man to repeat what he just said, or paraphrase his statement and check if that is
what he meant. You may wish to clarify how a person felt—‘You felt very frustrated?’ Point out
the logical consequences of what the person has said. Draw attention to apparent contradictions
to clarify what the person means or feels—‘It is interesting that in the last session you said
you had never enjoyed his company, but today you say you did have a good time together last
weekend.’ Use cognitive techniques to identify and challenge irrational automatic thoughts and
underlying assumptions (see also Chapter 10).
Encourage the expression of affect
Some patients will benefit from being encouraged to acknowledge and experience negative
affects such as guilt, shame or anger, especially in grief work. Promote a detailed discussion of
the relationship in question. Ask directly how the person feels. Remind him or her that certain
negative feelings are normal—‘Anybody would feel angry if they were treated like that’. People
are sometimes afraid to acknowledge unwanted feelings and impulses for fear that they might
act upon them. Reassure them about the difference between feeling and acting.
Other patients may need to be taught more effective ways of controlling their moods and
impulses. It is sometimes best for the person to avoid situations that arouse painful affect. Conflict
is often more effectively resolved after both parties first take some time to calm down and get
their feelings under control. Help the person to identify the thoughts that accompany a negative
affect. Then use structured problem solving to deal with the underlying stressors. Help patients
to identify and question irrational thoughts they have when they feel anxious or depressed (see
Chapter 10).
Communication analysis
The goal is to identify communication failures and to learn new and more effective skills.
Sometimes, conflicts arise simply through a lack of communication. Identify and modify the
following unhelpful communication styles: using ambiguous non-verbal communications, such
as sulking, remaining silent or self-harming; assuming that others know how one thinks or feels
without being told; not checking the veracity of a one’s assumptions (‘He thinks I’m a fool’);
or being unable to assert oneself or criticise another person because of exaggerated fears of the
consequences.
The therapeutic relationship
The way that people communicate with you can be taken as a model of how they relate to
others in their lives. It is useful to reflect on this interaction, especially when treating people with
1

Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 97
interpersonal deficits who have few other significant relationships. Ask patients to tell you if you
do something that upsets them. They then have the opportunity to rehearse being more assertive
and you have the opportunity to correct faulty assumptions that they make.
Behaviour change techniques
Use structured problem solving to help the person find workable solutions to their problems.
At times, it may be appropriate to give the person advice (see Chapter 6). Education plays an
important part in IPT—explaining the symptoms and treatment of depression, the relationship
of events in the person’s interpersonal life to the depressive symptoms, and the process of IPT. In
role-play, a (female) patient is asked to speak to the therapist as she would to the other person. This
will clarify her feelings about the person, demonstrate the effectiveness of her communications
and provide her with an opportunity to rehearse new ways of communicating.
Dealing with resistance in therapy
Patients may behave in ways that interfere with the process of therapy. They may, for example,
arrive late, miss appointments, remain silent or persist in discussing irrelevant material. Do not
ignore these behaviours, but rather discuss them openly and matter-of-factly. Sometimes, there
will be a simple reason for the behaviour, unrelated to the process of therapy. For example, a
person may consistently arrive late because the appointments are scheduled at an inconvenient
time. However, in other cases, the behaviour may be a manifestation of the person acting out—
that is, acting on an impulse to avoid a problem, rather than thinking about it and seeking
a rational solution to it. In such cases, it is important to bring the behaviour to the person’s
attention—discuss it, seek to understand its meaning, and help him or her find more effective
solutions to the underlying problems and more effective ways of communicating.
In IPT terms, resistance in therapy is an example of a role dispute in which the expectations of
the patient and the therapist are at odds. Discuss the behaviour and the way that it is interfering
with therapy. For example, the person who arrives late will not have sufficient time to deal
adequately with the material to be covered each week. Help the person recognise that these
behaviours represent indirect and inefficient ways of communicating. By openly discussing these
difficulties, the person is able to allay their fears about the direct discussion of problems and
experience how much more effective direct communication is in solving problems. The way
the problem is dealt with in therapy becomes a model for how the person can more effectively
deal with problems outside therapy.
In IPT terms, resistance in therapy is an example of a role dispute.
Behaviours that sabotage therapy often serve to avoid discussion of painful topics. Note the
context in which the avoidance behaviours occur. For example, a person may always change the
topic of discussion when a particularly painful issue is being discussed. The person may fear your
reaction to the problem. Try to engender a feeling of trust in the patient. Accept and normalise
unwanted feelings. Patients may fear that if they articulate unacceptable impulses, they will lose
control and act upon them. Emphasise the difference between feelings and impulses, which are
not under the person’s conscious control, and actions, which are.
In all forms of psychotherapy, it is important to monitor the transference and countertransference. Resist the temptation to advise dependent people on how they should solve
their problems. Instead, use counselling and structured problem solving to help deal with their
problems themselves. Discuss the differences between a therapeutic relationship and a friendship.
Do not self-disclose to patients and do not socialise with them. Monitor your own feelings
about patients: by acknowledging unacceptable impulses—you will be less likely to act out upon
them.
98
Combining IPT with pharmacotherapy
Like other forms of psychotherapy, IPT can and, in many cases, should be combined with drug
treatment for depression (see Chapter 14). Several studies suggest an additive effect of combined
therapy, especially in the treatment of severe depression. In particular, patients who have evidence
of neurovegetative function change (sleep, appetite and weight disturbance; psychomotor
agitation or retardation; anhedonia; and loss of libido) will benefit from medication in addition
to IPT. Individuals may have a particular preference for one or other form of treatment.
Training in IPT
You will need to read the text by Klerman and Weissman1
. The Hamilton Depression Rating
Scale (HAM-D) is the instrument that has been used to assess outcome in the major trials of
the efficacy of IPT2
.
Those wishing to practise IPT should read the text by Klerman and Weissman,
and video or audiotape at least one course of therapy.
To gain competence in IPT, you need to complete three supervised cases that are certified by
an IPT expert. It is useful to video or audiotape at least one course of treatment and discuss this,
session by session, within a group of your peers who are interested in IPT. Like the techniques of
CBT, there are probably several IPT techniques that you already use. I hope that this discussion
will encourage you to embark on further training.

Dynamically informed therapy
Psychodynamic treatments range across a broad spectrum from expressive therapies, including
psychoanalysis, which aims to produce personality change, to supportive therapies that aim to
improve coping by bolstering a person’s existing personality structures, including his or her
habitual coping styles and defences (see Chapter 8). The three main theoretical schools are egopsychology (Freud et al.), object relations (Klein, Mahler et al.) and self-psychology (Kohut,
Kernberg et al.).
In this chapter, I discuss eight dimensions of the psychodynamic assessment of personality that
are useful in formulating the psychological components of patients’ problems. I also describe
two psychodynamic interventions that can be used in general practice—empathic responses
and interpretation. I refer readers to Gabbard’s book for a detailed description of the different
psychodynamic theories and their application in therapy1
.
Impulse control
An impaired ability to delay the gratification of drives and desires may be manifest in substance
abuse, sexual promiscuity, paraphilias, binge-eating or a pattern of repeated violent or selfharming behaviour. The characteristic defence is ‘acting out’ (see page 102).
The characteristic defence of people with impaired impulse control is ‘acting
out’.
Impaired impulse control is a feature of the Cluster B personality disorders—borderline,
antisocial and histrionic (see Chapter 23). People with psychotic illnesses or depression may
also exhibit impaired impulse control. Biological factors that predispose to poor impulse control
include genetic factors, brain damage (especially to the frontal lobes), dementia, delirium, and
the abuse of alcohol and stimulants. Abused children who have been the victims of adults with
poor impulse control may be at risk of developing problems with impulse control themselves.
Some examples are shown in Box 12-1.
Chapter 12
Box 12-1: Examples of impaired impulse control
Antisocial personality disorder
A man with antisocial personality disorder has a long history of violent behaviour and substance abuse.
He tells you that on weekends he and his brother go to places frequented by homosexual men and
assault anyone who approaches them.
Psychosis
A man with schizophrenia sets fires in response to commands of the voices that he hears.
Depression
A depressed woman with no previous criminal history shoplifts some relatively inexpensive articles
that she could easily have afforded to buy. She cannot explain why she did it, but expresses how
ashamed she feels and her belief that she should be punished like any other criminal.
Borderline personality disorder
A woman who was sexually abused as a child has difficulty controlling her impulses to self-harm.

Psychiatric Press, 1994.

Self-esteem
A person’s perception of him or herself as a good person, worthy of the affection of others, is
impaired in depression. In ‘Mourning and Melancholia’, Freud described a loss of self-esteem as
one of the principal features of depression and one that distinguishes it from normal mourning1
.
People with personality disorders are predisposed to depression because of their low self-esteem.
In particular, child abuse may damage self-esteem (see Box 12-2).
People with a low self-esteem are vulnerable to depression.
Shame and guilt
Shame is the emotion that we experience when we fail to live up to our conception of how we
should behave. We feel ashamed when we do something embarrassing in front of other people.
How ashamed we feel will depend on what we actually do, the situation in which we do it and
the standards that we set for ourselves. One person may be mortified after making some minor
faux pas, while another is quite shameless about behaving in a manner repugnant to everyone in
his company. A man with an exacting and rigid idea of how he should behave will be vulnerable
to depression and anxiety.
By contrast, guilt is the emotion that we experience when we do something wrong that hurts
another person. It is associated with an expectation of punishment. The extent to which we feel
guilty depends on what we have done, as well as the strictures of our conscience. People with
rigid and punitive consciences may feel guilty over relatively minor perceived infractions and
be predisposed to depression. By contrast, those with little concern for the rights of others may
fail to experience guilt after seriously infringing the rights of others. Such people are prone to
anti-social activity. Examples are given in Box 12-3.
Shame is the emotion that we experience when we fail to live up to the image
we have of how we should behave. Guilt is the emotion that we experience
when we do something wrong that hurts another person.
Box 12-2: Examples of low self-esteem
Dependent personality disorder
A woman with a dependent personality disorder has a low self-esteem that is evident in her inability
to make decisions for herself. She has suffered recurrent bouts of depression.
Narcissistic personality disorder
A man with narcissistic personality disorder defends against his low self-esteem by his grandiosity,his
demands for constant praise and his rejection of any criticism. He used to be very proud of his sporting
prowess. He attended a gymnasium and was a member of the local lifesaving association. He becomes
depressed after suffering a myocardial infarction that will curtail his sporting activities.

Quality of relationships
The ability of a person to form enduring close relationships with others, including intimate
relationships, is an important measure of his or her psychological health. The quality of a person’s
relationships is an important factor in the prognosis of his or her mental disorder. The patterns
of relationships formed throughout life often reflect early bonds with parents and siblings.
These recurring patterns become evident during therapy in the transference and countertransference.
The patterns of relationships formed throughout life often reflect early bonds
with caregivers.
Bowlby writes that the presence of strong and stable attachments in early childhood permits
the child to begin to explore the world from a secure base and, in adulthood, to form intimate
relationships, and to be resilient in the face of stressful life-events. By contrast, children who form
anxious attachments are less well adapted and, in adulthood, have difficulty forming intimate
relationships, are vulnerable in the face of stressful life-events, and are prone to depression and
anxiety.
Defence mechanisms
Freud postulated that unconscious sexual and aggressive drives are prevented from reaching
consciousness by unconscious ego defence mechanisms. The primary defences are repression
and denial. Repression is the shutting out from consciousness of an unacceptable drive, wish or
other aspect of internal reality. Denial is the disavowal of unacceptable or threatening aspects of
external reality. Examples of repression and denial are given in Box 12-4.
The primary defences are repression and denial.
The maturity of the defence mechanisms that a person habitually uses is a useful indicator of his
or her psychological health and success in adaptation to life. The following hierarchy of defences,
from primitive to mature, is taken from Vaillant1
. Examples are shown in Box 12-5.
The maturity of defences that a person habitually uses is an indicator of his or
her psychological health.
Box 12-3: Examples of shame and guilt
•	A man with narcissistic traits is especially prone to feeling ashamed, because his extreme sensitivity
to criticism and rejection is coupled with an equally strong need to show off and impress others,
something that often backfires and turns people against him.
•	A man convicted of assault fails to feel any remorse. He is furious with the woman he assaulted,
because if it were not for her, he would not be in jail.
•	A young woman suffering from post-partum depression feels guilty because of angry thoughts
she has about her baby’s demands. She also feels ashamed that she has failed to be the kind of
mother she had wanted to be. She is described pre-morbidly as a perfectionist who is serious and
conscientious at work and rarely expresses anger.

102
Narcissistic defences
These are features of psychotic illnesses, but may also be evident in children before the age of
five and in adult dreams and fantasy. They include delusional projection, psychotic denial and
distortion.
Immature defences
These may be seen in normal children and young people between the ages of three and 16.
Adults with personality disorders also use these defences.
•	 Projection – the attribution of one’s own unacknowledged feelings to others. Its use is a
feature of paranoid personality disorder.
•	 Passive-aggression – the turning against oneself of hostile feelings towards others by
procrastinating, forgetting, being late for appointments, doing things deliberately slowly or
clowning around instead of completing a task
•	 Acting out – acting on an impulse without reflection in order to avoid experiencing a painful
affect and the thought that accompanies it
Neurotic defences
•	 Displacement – shifting an unacceptable feeling about an important and powerful person in
one’s life on to someone less powerful
•	 Intellectualisation – the excessive use of intellectual processes as a means of avoiding the
experience of distressing feelings
•	 Reaction formation – warding off an unconscious wish or impulse by adopting a characteristic
trait that is diametrically opposed to it
•	 Dissociation – the compartmentalisation of one’s identity to avoid emotional distress (see
also Chapter 21). A person may be amnesic for a traumatic event, but suffer flashbacks of it.
Counterphobic behaviour may defend against feelings of inadequacy and fear. An actor is
able to dissociate into the character that he portrays. Members of a fundamentalist church
Box 12-4: Examples of the primary defences – repression and denial
•	Repression
A woman becomes depressed on the anniversary of her husband’s death. Her husband was an
alcoholic who abused her verbally and physically throughout the marriage, and prevented her
developing her own social networks.
Comment: She has repressed the anger she has towards her husband over his abuse, and now, his
abandonment of her. Her inability to acknowledge and work through her ambivalent feelings has
inhibited the mourning process.
•	Denial
A man with schizophrenia denies that he has a mental illness and criticises his general practitioner
for forcing him to take medication. He nevertheless attends his appointments regularly and is
adherent to medication.
Comment: The man’s denial of the illness helps him cope. Displacement of the problem on to the
doctor and the medication allows him to vent his frustration externally rather than with himself or
with an illness that he cannot escape.
•	Denial
A woman retains hope in spite of being told that her bowel cancer is inoperable, believing that the
diet she is on and the herbal remedies she takes will cure it.
Comment: A degree of denial is adaptive in any grief reaction. Unless she is being exploited by
someone promising a cure, it is probably best not to challenge her denial.

dissociate when they speak in tongues. Like all of the secondary defences, dissociation is
preceded by repression or denial. It is distinguished from repression by being a vertical split in
which mental contents are stored in a parallel consciousness; in repression, there is a horizontal
split with material being transferred to the unconscious.
Mature defences
These include humour, anticipation, sublimation and altruism.
Box 12-5: Examples of ego defence mechanisms
Projection
A man defends against an unacknowledged and unacceptable desire for sexual relations with a family
friend by repression of the impulse and projection of it on to his wife, whom he begins to accuse of
infidelity.
Passive-aggression
You are seeing a couple for marital counselling. The husband arrives 15 minutes late for the appointment.
His wife says that this is typical of him—he is never on time. He gave up his middle management
position in the public service three years ago to enrol in post-graduate studies in philosophy. He
receives a small allowance from the government, but his wife has been largely responsible for supporting
the family over this period. He is having difficulty completing his thesis and has already had two
extensions of the date it is due. Last weekend, he ‘forgot’ that his wife’s parents were coming to dinner
and arrived home just as they were leaving having spent the evening in the library working with
newfound enthusiasm on the thesis.
Acting out
A young woman with borderline personality disorder cuts herself with a razor blade. When asked what
she was thinking about at the time, she states that she cannot remember. Nor can she describe how she
was feeling; and she cannot identify any precipitant for her action.
Displacement
A man is under financial pressure having to support his wife and five children and pay off a home
mortgage from the living he makes as a salesman. His boss is constantly reminding him of the need to
meet the monthly sales targets—a failure to do so is met by veiled threats about job security. The man’s
wife is upset and embarrassed by his increasingly extreme views about Aborigines and migrants that
he angrily propounds whenever they have friends over.
Intellectualisation
A woman consults you four months after the death of her 15-year-old son from leukaemia. She
is exasperated because her husband is spending more and more of his time researching alternative
medical treatments for cancer. He spends most evenings scanning the Internet for new information.
She feels she can discuss nothing else with him, including their son’s death.
Reaction formation
A young woman presents to you depressed. She is married with three children, aged one, three, and
five years. She has always appeared anxious to do the best for her children. She says that her husband
and mother both say that she ‘spoils’ them, but she cannot help it. She brings the children to see you
frequently, often with relatively minor problems. Despite having some family supports, she has never
used a baby-sitter, always insisting she should look after the children herself.
In the context of a strong therapeutic relationship with you, she begins to be able to recognise and
accept as normal, her occasional frustration and anger at the demands placed upon her by her children.
She may later begin to be able to deal with her feelings by using more mature defences, such as
humour and sublimation.
Dissociation
A young woman is amnesic for a vehicle accident in which her boyfriend was killed. Despite suffering
no serious injury herself in the accident, she continues to suffer frightening nightmares, she feels
constantly tense and irritable, and she has withdrawn from most of her usual social activities.
104
Developmental stages
A number of writers have described sequences of stages in human psychological development.
Unlike the psychosexual stages described by Freud that focus on early development, the stages
in psychosocial development described by Erikson cover the whole of the life cycle. Each stage
is characterised by a core conflict (see Table 12-1)1
. Coping with normal developmental tasks is
stressful and can precipitate mental health problems (Box 12-6).

Regression
Regression is a common sign of mental distress, especially in children. People who have
not resolved early developmental conflicts are prone to regression when under stress. This is
particularly likely to occur when a stressor reactivates earlier conflicts (see Box 12-7).

A rebellious adolescent girl has recently been discovered with a small quantity of marijuana. She
belongs to a peer group who dress exclusively in black, wear nose-rings and are obsessed with the
music of Nirvana.

A 30-year-old single man presents lonely and depressed. He has never managed to sustain an intimate
relationship for longer than six months.
Generativity versus stagnation
A 45-year-old man is going through a ‘mid-life crisis’. He is dissatisfied with his work where he realises
he will never progress. He is separated from his wife, who has custody of their two children. He has
been living alone since the brief affair that he had with a colleague at work finished six months ago.
Ego-integrity versus despair
A 66-year-old man becomes depressed nine months after retiring from the staff of the school where
he had taught over the past 25 years.

Repetition compulsion
The preceding example illustrates how patterns of early attachments often tend to repeat
themselves throughout a person’s life, even though these patterns may have been painful or even
abusive. It seems that any attachment is better than none (see Box 12-8).
Patterns of early attachments often repeat themselves throughout a person’s
life even though these patterns may have been painful or even abusive.
Two interventions derived from dynamic psychotherapy
In this section, I briefly discuss the use of empathy and interpretation in psychotherapy. Empathy
is an essential component in understanding a person’s problems and an empathic style is one of
the most robust predictors of general practitioners recognising their patients’ mental disorders. An
empathic approach also plays an important role in therapy. It is central to the self-psychological
approaches of Kohut. Interpretation is a cornerstone of all dynamic therapy.
Empathy
Empathy is experiencing ourselves what it is like to be in the position of another person. We can
feel the sadness of someone who tells of the death of a loved one. We can experience the anger
of someone who has been frustrated and deceived. As well as being a tool for understanding
patients, empathic responses strengthen the therapeutic alliance and can, themselves, produce
change (see Box 12-9).
Box 12-7: Example of regression
A 24-year-old man consults you about a number of current problems, but his main need seems to be
to talk about himself and for you to listen. If you attempt to interrupt, he quickly becomes anxious
and agitated, speaking more quickly, often simply ignoring what you have to say. He seems driven to
complete what he wishes to say and sometimes brings a list of things he needs to tell you. Just as the
session is about to finish he tells you how angry he was with another doctor who, he says, was always
rigid about the time, ‘throwing’ him out when time was up. You know from his background that, as
a child, his father would often come home drunk and, after arguing with his wife, come to the boy’s
room and insist that he get out of bed and listen as he recounted the problems and frustrations of his
day.
Comment: At an age when he needed support and nurture from his parents, he instead had to provide
his father with support and sympathy. Ten years later, he is still seeking the care that he missed as a
child. In the transference, he becomes like his father, and you experience, in the counter-transference,
how he felt as a child.
Box 12-8: Example of repetition compulsion
You see a young man whose wife has recently taken out a restraining order to prevent him visiting her.
She recently left him, together with their two young children. On describing his background, he tells
you that he hated his father. His earliest memories are of his father coming home drunk and verbally
and physically abusing his wife while the children hid under their beds, knowing that they might be
the next victims of his rage.
Comment: Despite suffering at the hands of his father as a child, he has nevertheless identified with him
(identification with the aggressor) and now acts like him.
106
Empathic responses strengthen the therapeutic alliance and can, themselves,
produce change.
Repeated empathic failures by caretakers during infancy and early childhood are thought to
predispose to problems in self-esteem, and in one’s sense of identity and personal coherence in
adulthood. A consequence of the low self-regard of people with narcissistic personalities is an
extreme sensitivity to any minor sleight or perceived insult. Empathic responses during therapy
can, over a period of time, ameliorate these traits (see Box 12-10).
Repeated empathic failures in infancy are thought to contribute to the
development of narcissistic personality disorder.
Be careful that by being empathic you do not collude with the person’s problems and make them
worse. Reflect on the transference and countertransference in order to avoid pseudoempathic
responses (see Box 12-11).
Be careful that by empathising with a person’s experience you do not reinforce
his or her maladaptive behaviour patterns.
Interpretation
Interpretation covers a wide range of interventions. It may simply involve a clarification of what
a person says or how that person feels. For example, when an elderly man says that his daughter
failed to visit him over the weekend, you might say, ‘You would have felt let down...angry with
her’.
You might interpret a defence. For example, when a woman whose mother recently died talks
at length about current problems with the local council, and the weather, you might interpret
her denial by saying, ‘It is too painful for you to talk about your mother’s death’.
Defence mechanisms are deployed in order to solve some intrapsychic conflict. The equilibrium
that they provide may be the most adaptive solution to a person’s problems at that time. For
Box 12-9: Empathic response
A 63-year-old woman becomes depressed six months after her husband’s death from complications
of alcoholic liver disease. You know that she had to tolerate both verbal and physical abuse over the
years of their marriage. After he died, others reported that she ‘coped very well’. She reports that she
has never cried over his death.
You can empathise with the ambivalent feelings she has towards her husband. These make it
difficult for her to mourn his death. In the context of a trusting relationship with you, she begins to
acknowledge her anger towards him, as well as her guilt that she had sometimes wished he were dead.
Acknowledging these negative affects within the therapeutic alliance will allow her to experience her
sadness and to mourn her loss. (If her symptoms of depression persist, she may also require treatment
with antidepressants).
Box 12-10: Example of empathic failures in childhood
A 28-year-old man is furious with you because you are late for his appointment. You feel angry at such
entitled and demanding behaviour, but recognising these feelings, you take care not to act it out. When
he settles down, you acknowledge his feeling of hurt and explain why you were running late. It might
then be appropriate to make an interpretation. For example, ‘You get very upset when people do not
meet their commitments to you’.

example, the numbing that is evident in people who have recently been exposed to a severe
trauma is, at least initially, adaptive because it prevents the person from being overwhelmed. Two
years after the event, however, such denial is not adaptive and may lead to severe handicap—
withdrawal from social supports and a loss of access to pleasurable activities. It is a matter of
judgment when to interpret a defence. In the midst of a crisis it is often better to bolster a
person’s defences, but once the crisis is over it may be helpful to interpret and try to change
them. Removing a defence will always cause some anxiety. It should be remembered that the
development of psychotic symptoms is one of the recognised complications of psychoanalysis.
You might make an interpretation within the transference (see Box 12-12)
For the most part, the interpretations that you make in general practice will be clarifications.
Making interpretations at deeper levels can be problematic. Even though an interpretation may
be correct, it is not necessarily helpful and may even be damaging. For example, a 14-yearold boy who lives with his mother and stepfather is having problems at school. The following
might be true, but it would certainly be inappropriate—‘You are displacing the anger with your
oedipal rival on to your teachers’. As a rule, the patient makes the most effective interpretations
him or herself, with you providing the trusting and empathic relationship that allows such selfreflection.
In general practice, the commonest interpretations are clarifications.
Interpretations at deeper levels can be problematic.
Box 12-11: Pseudoempathy
•	A 42-year-old woman seeks your advice in solving a large number of domestic problems. She
presents herself as helpless. She needs you to tell her what to do.
Comment: You may empathise with her feelings of dependency and her wish for others to make
decisions for her, but it would be a mistake to respond to this by telling her how she should organise
her domestic affairs. Be aware of the transference and counter-transferenc—in this case a child-like
dependent transference that evokes in you a paternal/maternal countertransference to take care of
her.
•	A young man with antisocial personality disorder describes the pleasure he takes in his criminal
activity.
Comment: You should take care not to empathise with his excitement and enjoyment, his sense of
entitlement and self-justification, and his lack of responsibility. Such collusion will only reinforce
his antisocial behaviour. You might instead make it clear that while you will listen to him, you do
not approve of his behaviour. If, for example, he boasts, ‘If some guy gets in my way there will only
be one of us left standing’, you might say, ‘You mean you would assault him’. Or, if he gloats over
taking advantage of someone, ‘So you mean you sold him something worthless’. Or if he says, ‘I will
finish him if I see him’, you might ask, ‘Are you threatening to commit murder?’ You might add, ‘I
have to tell you that there is nothing I can do in your defence as a doctor if you commit a crime’.
If he persists with his threats, you should alert the police and the person under threat.
Box 12-12: Interpretation within the transference
A young man who has problems with authority figures arrives late for his appointment. He is sullen
and curt in his responses and avoids eye contact with you. You might say, ‘You feel angry with me’. He
might then make an association. For example, ‘Yes, you remind me of this teacher who always put me
down…’ Later, he makes a link to his father who was always critical of him and seemed impossible
to please.
108
The correct timing of an interpretation is vital, and your empathy with a patient will be a good
guide. For example, in the case of the old man mentioned previously, you might realise that he
was neither sad nor angry that his daughter did not visit him. He was pleased, because it meant
he could go fishing with the man next door.
Reflect on the countertransference and ensure that you are not acting out when making an
interpretation. For example, a young woman with borderline personality disorder may evoke in
you intense feelings of anger. If you do not recognise this, you may act out by making a cruel
statement to her masked as an interpretation.
Finally, there is always the danger of wanting to be clever. The elegance of an insight can
sometimes tempt us to make an interpretation that is either wrong or mistimed. As a rule, it is
better to say nothing—to listen and clarify, rather than risk making an interpretation that may
be perceived by the patient as unempathic, demeaning or even insulting.
Training
The aim of this chapter was to acquaint you with some of the principles of dynamic psychotherapy
that may help improve your understanding of patients and deepen your formulations of their
problems. If you wish to perform short-term dynamic psychotherapy, you should first undergo
a period of training and supervision.

Pharmacological treatments
This chapter contains brief descriptions of the classes of drugs that are most commonly used
in the treatment of mental disorders. The recommended doses are for physically healthy adults
of average weight. Adjustments need to be made for elderly people, children, young people
and those with physical illnesses. Drug treatments for mental disorders are changing rapidly. I
therefore, recommend that you obtain each new edition of Therapeutic Guidelines, as it becomes
available1
.
General practitioners are advised to obtain a copy of each new edition of
Therapeutic Guidelines as it becomes available.2
Antipsychotics
Traditional antipsychotics have been used in the treatment of psychosis since the 1950s.
Recently, five new drugs have become available in Australia—clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine,
olanzapine and amisulpride. These have different mechanisms of action, side effect profiles and
therapeutic responses from conventional antipsychotics. See also Chapter 22 for practical tips on
the prescription of these drugs.
Traditional antipsychotics
These drugs are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through the blockade of D2 dopamine
receptors in mesolimbic and mesocortical systems. The main indication is the treatment of
positive symptoms of psychosis (i.e. hallucinations, delusions and formal thought disorder)
and the prevention of relapse in schizophrenia. They are less effective and slower to act in the
alleviation of negative symptoms. In fact, they may worsen negative symptoms when used in
high doses. They are also used in the treatment of other acutely disturbed people, for example,
the delirious patient.
There is no evidence that any one traditional antipsychotic is more effective than another. The
differences are in the side effect profiles. In general, low potency drugs, such as chlorpromazine,
cause more sedation and anticholinergic side effects, but only moderate extrapyramidal side
effects, while high potency compounds, such as fluphenazine, trifluoperazine, haloperidol and
thiothixene, have more extrapyramidal effects, but cause less sedation and fewer anticholinergic
effects.
Low potency antipsychotics cause more sedation and anticholinergic side
effects. High potency drugs cause more extrapyramidal side effects.
Depot preparations of fluphenazine (Modecate), haloperidol (Haldol), flupenthixol (Fluanxol),
risperidone (Risperdal Consta) and zuclopenthixol (Clopixol) may be prescribed when adherence
to oral medication is in doubt. Note that the depot medication is zuclopenthixol decanoate
(Clopixol Depot). Zuclopenthixol acetate (Clopixol Acuphase) is used for the management of
psychiatric emergencies and can cause marked sedation for around three days.

Recommended doses of antipsychotics are lower than those used in the past. Doses above 15mg
equivalent of haloperidol have no additional antipsychotic effect, but certainly increase the
incidence of adverse effects. Antipsychotics take at least two weeks to begin to produce their
therapeutic effect. In the treatment of first episodes of psychosis, they may take as long as 11
weeks to act. Therefore, it is important to be patient and not increase doses prematurely in the
early phases of treatment.
Doses above 15mg equivalent of haloperidol produce more side effects, but no
additional antipsychotic effect.
In acute psychosis, control of disturbed behaviour can be gained through adjunctive treatment
with a benzodiazepine. Antipsychotics are usually continued for at least 12 months following a
first episode of psychosis. If the person remains symptom free, the dose may then be gradually
lowered and then ceased. It is wise to follow up patients for at least 12 months after ceasing an
antipsychotic.
Use anticholinergics to avoid dystonic reactions early in treatment or when the dose changes.
Young men are particularly prone to suffering dystonic reactions, especially when administered
potent antipsychotics. Once a steady dose has been established, the anticholinergic can usually be
withdrawn. Anticholinergics have significant side effects of their own—dry mouth, constipation,
blurred vision, worsening of glaucoma, urinary obstruction and confusion. In the elderly, they
can cause delirium. Moreover, with the exception of Parkinsonism, they are of limited value in
treating the other extra-pyramidal syndromes. For persistent extrapyramidal symptoms, consider
dose reduction or switching to one of the newer antipsychotics.
Once a steady dose of antipsychotic has been established, anticholinergic agents
can usually be withdrawn.
Adverse effects
1. Extrapyramidal effects – These are caused by dopamine blockade in nigrostriatal pathways.
a) Acute dystonia involves muscular spasm of the extra-ocular muscles (oculogyric crisis),
the neck, trunk or hands. Young males are particularly at risk, especially early in treatment.
Laryngeal dystonia can be fatal. Always warn patients and their carers about dystonic
reactions. Laryngeal dystonia can be accompanied by a feeling of tongue swelling. Be
careful not to mistake this for an allergic reaction. Consider the use of an anticholinergic
agent, especially when commencing treatment with one of the potent antipsychotics.
b) Akathisia is a feeling of agitation usually accompanied by restless legs. It is a particularly
unpleasant side effect. Since people often do not recognise that it is a drug side effect, you
should inquire about it. It is generally less responsive to anticholinergic treatment than
dystonias and Parkinsonian side effects. Treat it by reducing the dose or by changing to
one of the newer antipsychotics. Diazepam and propranolol may help some people cope
with this side effect.
Akathisia tends to respond poorly to anticholinergics. Treat it by reducing the
antipsychotic dose or changing to one of the newer atypical agents.
c) Parkinsonian side effects include rigidity, bradykinesia and a fine tremor. On examination,
cogwheeling may be present. Parkinsonian side effects may be complicated by falls,
especially in the elderly. They may be mistaken for signs of a depressive syndrome.
Anticholinergics may reduce acute Parkinsonian symptoms, but dose reduction or
changing to a newer antipsychotic are better long-term strategies.
Pharmacological treatments
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 111
d) Tardive Dyskinesia is a potentially permanent adverse effect of antipsychotics involving
abnormal choreoathetoid movements, especially of the tongue, mouth, lips and jaw. It
may also affect muscles of the limbs and trunk. Tardive Dystonia involves mass involuntary
contractions of muscles of the tongue, face, neck and back. The risk of developing these
side effects increases with increasing exposure to traditional antipsychotics. However, they
can occur after only limited exposure. The elderly (especially older women) and people
with brain damage are at higher risk of developing the tardive syndromes. Remember
that antipsychotics, while causing these adverse effects, also suppress their manifestations.
As a consequence, they may first become evident after dose reduction. Since there is no
known treatment, it is important to minimise the risk of its development by using the
lowest effective dose of antipsychotic.
With the advent of the atypical antipsychotics, which appear to have a lower propensity
to cause these adverse effects, it is essential to carefully monitor for the development of
tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia. I recommend that screening should be performed
and documented at least once a year for people on long-term treatment (see Abnormal
Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS), Appendix 10).
Use the AIMS instrument to screen for the presence of tardive dyskinesia at
least once a year.
2. Anticholinergic effects – These include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision and urinary
retention. In the elderly, antipsychotics can cause delirium, especially when used together
with other drugs with anticholinergic effects (for example, antiparkinsonians or tricyclics).
They may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma. Low potency agents such as chlorpromazine
have the most pronounced anticholinergic effects, risperidone the least.
3. Sedation is thought to be due to histamine receptor blockade. Always advise patients of
possible effects on driving, and the interaction with alcohol.
4. Postural hypotension – Adrenoceptor blockade leads to a failure of the reflex constriction of
veins in the lower limbs that normally occurs on standing. Patients should be advised to take
care when rising, to sit on the edge of the bed before getting up, and to sit down if they feel
faint or dizzy. This side effect is most pronounced with low potency antipsychotics such as
chlorpromazine.
5. Sexual dysfunction – Antipsychotics can cause erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory
dysfunction. These effects are most pronounced with thioridazine and least with olanzapine
and quetiapine.
6. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome – This is a rare syndrome, but has a mortality rate of
between five and 10 per cent. It presents with fever, muscular rigidity, autonomic instability
(fluctuating pulse rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate) and delirium. Electrolytes,
liver function and creatinine phosphokinase are elevated. It is a medical emergency, often
requiring admission to an intensive care unit for supportive measures to lower temperature
and to maintain blood pressure and hydration. Dantrolene is sometimes used to lessen muscle
rigidity.
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a medical emergency that presents with
fever, muscular rigidity, autonomic instability and delirium.
7. Retinal pigmentation, caused by the deposition of pigmented granules, can lead to decreased
acuity, poor night vision and ‘browning’ of vision. Those on thioridazine are most at risk. Any
person on long-term thioridazine should have an annual ophthalmological examination.
112
8. Photosensitivity – People prescribed chlorpromazine are most at risk. They should be advised
to wear a hat when out of doors and to use a blockout sunscreen. Yearly ophthalmological
examinations for lens opacities are advisable for those on long-term treatment.
9. All of these drugs can cause ECG changes. Thioridazine can now only be prescribed to
people with schizophrenia who have failed to respond to treatment with at least two other
antipsychotic drugs. It is contraindicated in combination with other drugs that inhibit
cytochrome P450 2D6 and drugs that prolong the QTc interval. It is also contraindicated
in people with a history of cardiac arrhythmias or congenital long QT syndrome. Periodic
monitoring of the QTc interval and serum potassium are required. People with a pretreatment QTc interval greater than 450 msecs should not receive the drug. It should be
discontinued in patients with QTc greater than 500 msecs.
Instances of sudden death have occurred with pimozide.
10. Hyperprolactinaemia is caused by dopamine receptor blockade in the tubuloinfundibular
pathways. It may be manifest by galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea and reduced libido.
Atypical antipsychotics
These include risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, amisulpride and clozapine. They are thought
to exert their action through the blockade of dopamine, and serotonin receptors. Clozapine is
effective in 10– 20 per cent of cases resistant to treatment with other antipsychotics. All have a
lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal effects. They are effective in reducing both negative
and positive symptoms. Risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine and amisulpride are presently
only available on authority prescription for people with schizophrenia. Clozapine can cause
neutropaenia in 5–10 per cent of people and agranulocytosis in 0.5–1 per cent. It has also been
associated with potentially fatal myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Side effects include weight
gain, sedation, postural hypertension, hypersalivation, constipation and a decrease in seizure
threshold. Consequently, it can only be prescribed at sites registered with the Clozaril Patient
Monitoring System.
The newer antipsychotics cause fewer extrapyramidal side effects and are
associated with fewer negative symptoms. Clozapine is effective in some cases
that are resistant to other antipsychotics.
The atypical antipsychotics are generally better tolerated than conventional antipsychotics,
however, they are not free of adverse effects (see Table 13-1). Atypical antipsychotics, especially
clozapine and olanzapine, have been linked to impaired glucose metabolism, weight gain, raised
lipid levels and an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Of particular concern are
reports of patients treated with clozapine and olanzapine developing diabetic ketoacidosis shortly
after initiation of the drug. Patients treated with these agents should be routinely screened for
diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities, including raised lipid levels. Patients with other risk
factors for diabetes should be monitored more closely.1
Antidepressants
The newer antidepressants are safer in overdose than tricyclics.
There are eight classes of antidepressants currently available in Australia—tricyclics, tetracyclics,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), reversible
Pharmacological treatments

inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (RIMAs), serotonin receptor antagonists, selective inhibitors
of noradrenaline reuptake (SNRIs) and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants
(NaSSAs). For a list of the advantages and disadvantages of the different classes of antidepressants,
see Table 13-3. Drug interactions with the newer antidepressants are shown in Table 13-2, and
recommendations for changing antidepressants are given in Table 13-4.
Antidepressants are used not only in the treatment of depression, but also in anxiety disorders
such as panic disorder, and in chronic pain. Clomipramine and the SSRIs have been shown to
be effective in the treatment of obsessions. All antidepressants can precipitate mania in people
with bipolar mood disorder, but there is some evidence that this is less likely with SSRIs1
. The
concurrent administration of lithium or an anticonvulsant mood stabiliser lessens the likelihood
of this occurring.
The concurrent administration of a mood stabilising drug together with an
antidepressant can prevent the development of mania in people with bipolar
disorder.
Patients need to be informed that these drugs take two to four weeks to begin to have their
antidepressant effect. To prevent relapse after a first episode of major depression, they should be
continued for at least six to 12 months.
There is a delay of between two and four weeks before antidepressants begin
to have their antidepressant effect.
Tricyclic antidepressants
These drugs have been available for some years and have proven efficacy, but they have a higher
side effect burden than the newer antidepressants. They are thought to exert their antidepressant
effect through inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline into presynaptic
neurones.
Half-lives are between 15 and 30 hours, allowing a single dose, usually at night. The drugs should
be started at a low dose, for example, 50mg at night, and then gradually increased over one to
two weeks up to 150mg a day. Lower doses should be used in elderly people.
Tricyclics are dangerous in overdose and can be fatal because of their effects on cardiac conduction
and their propensity to lower seizure threshold. They may cause a variety of arrhythmias,
including ventricular tachycardia, and complete heart block. Patients should be asked about any
suicide plans. It is often advisable to prescribe only a week’s supply of the drug at a time.
Tricyclics can cause death in overdose through cardiac conduction
abnormalities, seizures or respiratory arrest.
Adverse effects
Tricyclics have a wide range of potential adverse effects. Patients should be informed of these
before commencing treatment.
1. Anticholinergic effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention
and tachycardia. Tricyclics can cause an anticholinergic delirium, especially in the elderly.
Amitriptyline and clomipramine are strong anticholinergics, whereas desipramine is relatively
weak.
2. Sedation is thought to be due to histamine and alpha-adrenergic blockade. Amitriptyline and

doxepin are quite sedating, desipramine less so. Patients should be advised not to drive until
tolerance to this side effect has developed. They should also be advised of the potentiation
of sedation by alcohol.
3. Postural hypotension, sexual dysfunction and weight gain are caused by alpha-adrenergic
blockade.
4. Cardiac conduction abnormalities – Tricyclics have a quinidine-like anti-arrhythmic action
as well as antimuscarinic effects. They are contraindicated in people with severe conduction
abnormalities (e.g. second or third degree atrioventricular block or right bundle branch
block,) or within two months of a myocardial infarction. They should be used with caution
in patients with ischaemic heart disease or ventricular arrhythmias.1
 People over 40 years old
or otherwise at risk should have a cardiovascular system examination and an ECG before
commencing treatment with a tricyclic. These drugs can cause sudden death in children and
young people.
5. Seizures – Tricyclics lower the seizure threshold and should be used with care in people with
a history of epilepsy.
6. Precipitation of mania.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
The SSRIs are as effective as tricyclics in the treatment of depression. They have fewer side effects
because of their lower affinity for acetylcholine, dopamine, histamine and adrenoreceptors. They
are much safer drugs with minimal effects on cardiac conduction. SSRIs currently available in
Australia include fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine and citalopram.
The effective half-life of fluoxetine is long (between one and two weeks) because of its active
metabolite, norfluoxetine. Therefore, it takes over a month to reach steady state levels. It also
inhibits liver metabolism and so increases the plasma levels of several drugs, including tricyclics.
The half-lives of paroxetine and sertraline are around 24 hours, with steady-state concentrations
being reached after about a week. A dose of one tablet taken in the morning is usually adequate
(fluoxetine 20mg, paroxetine 20mg, sertraline 50mg, fluvoxamine 50mg or citalopram 20mg).
Adverse reactions include nausea, diarrhoea, headache, tremor, agitation and anxiety. Because
of their activating side effects, these drugs are usually taken as a single dose in the morning. A
benzodiazepine may be prescribed at night during the first two weeks for insomnia. Unlike
tricyclics, the SSRIs do not alter sleep architecture and so usually improve sleep once they are
having their antidepressant effect. They cause sexual dysfunction, especially delayed ejaculation.
Although they are relatively free of cardiovascular side effects and have a low lethality in overdose,
they must not be taken with MAOIs or RIMAs because of the risk of causing a potentially fatal
serotonergic syndrome. A washout period of at least five half-lives is required before changing
from an SSRI to a MAOI (i.e. 5 weeks for fluoxetine and 2 weeks for sertraline and paroxetine).
SSRIs inhibit the breakdown of tricyclics. Therefore, they should not be prescribed together.
SSRIs inhibit the breakdown of tricyclics and so should not be prescribed
together with them.

Irreversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAOIs)
Two MAOIs are available in Australia—phenelzine and tranylcypromine. Since these drugs are
irreversible inhibitors of MAO, it takes around two weeks before normal levels of the enzyme
are restored after cessation of the drug. They are also non-selective, inhibiting both MAO-A and
MAO-B. Their use is limited because of their propensity to cause serious adverse reactions, and
because of dangerous interactions with foods and other drugs (see Table 13-5). We recommend
that they only be prescribed on the advice of a psychiatrist. Doses of phenelzine commence at
15mg morning and midday, increasing to between 45mg and 60mg a day up to a maximum of
45mg bd; tranylcypromine, beginning at 10mg bd increasing to 30–40mg/day with a maximum
of 30mg bd.
The use of MAOIs is limited because of their propensity to cause serious
adverse reactions—in particular, because of their dangerous interactions with
other drugs and foods.
Hypertensive crisis
This potentially fatal adverse reaction is caused by an interaction with foods that contain tyramine
or other sympathomimetic amines, or with sympathomimetic drugs (e.g. cold remedies that
contain phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine). A list of foods and drugs that must be avoided is
shown in Table 13-5. Tyramine is usually metabolised by MAO-A present in the bowel wall and
the liver. When the action of this enzyme is inhibited, tyramine enters the systemic circulation
leading to the release of amines from peripheral nerve endings, which in turn may cause a
hypertensive crisis. Symptoms include headache, flushing, photophobia, nausea and vomiting,
and palpitations.

The drug interaction with pethidine can cause fever, labile blood pressure, delirium and coma.
MAOIs may need to be ceased before a general anaesthetic.
Reaction with tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs
The interaction can cause a serotonergic syndrome with tremor, incoordination, diarrhoea,
abdominal cramping, agitation, delirium, tachycardia, hypertension, coma and death.
The common side effects of MAOIs include the following:
•	 postural hypotension
•	 dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation (anticholinergic)
•	 sexual dysfunction – anorgasmia, impotence and ejaculatory failure
• arousal and insomnia – for this reason, the drugs are usually prescribed in divided doses in the
morning and at midday
• sedation – some people are sedated rather than aroused.
Reversible selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase
Moclobemide differs from conventional MAOIs in two ways. First, it is selective, inhibiting
the action of MAO-A, but not of MAOI-B. Consequently, it does not produce the tyramine
reaction. Second, its action is reversible with normal activity of MAO-A being restored within
two to three days of cessation of the drug. Doses usually begin at 150mg bd and are increased to
300–600mg bd (morning and midday) over the following one to two weeks.
Adverse effects include nausea, anxiety, insomnia, headache and dizziness. It should not be
prescribed together with pethidine. Cimetidine inhibits its metabolism, so the dose should be
halved if used together with this drug.
RIMAs should not be prescribed together with pethidine.
Mianserin
Mianserin has a tetracyclic structure. Its antidepressant action is not well understood. It is an
antagonist at presynaptic alpha-2-adrenergic, serotonergic and histaminic receptors. It is strongly
sedative. It has fewer cardiotoxic effects and is less lethal in overdose than the tricyclics. Doses
begin with 30–60mg at night and are increased over the following week to 90–120mg at
night.
It can cause neutropaenia. Therefore, it is advisable to perform a blood count before commencing
the drug and then monthly over the first three months. A full blood examination is also advisable
if any signs of infection develop, for example, sore throat or fever. The patient should be advised
that these symptoms might be early evidence of neutropaenia and to consult a doctor if they
develop. Mianserin can also cause polyarthritis.
Nefazodone
Nefazodone is a serotonin receptor antagonist. Adverse effects include dry mouth, nausea,
sedation, dizziness, constipation, fatigue, light-headedness, blurred vision and tinnitus. The
incidence of sexual dysfunction is said to be less than with SSRIs.
The manufacturer recommends a gradual increase in dose from 50mg bd in the first week to
200mg bd in the third week. Recommended therapeutic doses are between 300mg and 600mg
a day.

122 Pharmacological treatments
Venlafaxine
Venlafaxine is an inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline (SNRI). It has proven
efficacy in severe depression. However, its use is limited by a relatively high side effect burden
and discontinuation symptoms. Adverse effects include nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue,
anxiety, headache, dizziness, insomnia or somnolence, increased sweating, sexual dysfunction and
increased blood pressure. Discontinuation symptoms include headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness
and dysphoria. Recommended doses are between 75 and 375mg a day in divided doses.
Venlafaxine is a potent antidepressant. Its use is sometimes limited by its side
effects and withdrawal effects.
Mirtazapine
Mirtazapine is a Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressant (NaSSA). It enhances
both noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission while at the same time blocking 5HT2 and
5HT3
 receptors. The blocking action permits selective 5H1
 stimulation and, as a consequence,
limits the occurrence of troublesome serotonergic side effects such as insomnia, sexual dysfunction,
anxiety, agitation and headache, nausea and vomiting. The principal side effects are sedation (due
to its antihistaminic action), weight gain, dry mouth (an adrenergic effect) and headache. It has
a low propensity for drug interactions and generally, no withdrawal symptoms. Recommended
doses are between 15 and 45 mg/day, given as a once daily dose at night. Paradoxically, sedation
may be more pronounced at low compared to high doses.
Antimanic drugs
Lithium
Lithium is the treatment of choice for mania, both in the acute phase and in its prevention. The
half-life is between 10 and 40 hours. Therefore, it takes between 2 and 10 days to reach a steadystate concentration. It is eliminated through renal excretion and so must be prescribed with care
in people who suffer renal impairment, including those with congestive cardiac failure.
Its therapeutic range is between 0.5 and 1.2mmol/L, but higher levels (up to 1.4mmol/L) may
be needed in the treatment of acute mania. Levels between 0.6 and 0.8mmol/L are usually
adequate for prophylaxis. Lithium is usually started at a dose of around 250–500mg bd with the
serum level being checked after five days and necessary adjustments then being made to the
dose.
Before commencing lithium, tests of renal function and thyroid function should be performed.
We recommend the following monitoring regime for those on long-term lithium: serum lithium
every 3/12, renal function (electrolytes, creatinine and urea) every 6/12, and thyroid function
annually.
Serum lithium should be checked every 3/12, renal function every 6/12 and
thyroid function every 12/12.
At therapeutic levels, lithium can cause a fine tremor, muscle weakness, problems with memory
and concentration, weight gain, polydipsia and polyuria (in 15–30 per cent of people), and rarely,
extrapyramidal effects. Long-term adverse effects include hypothyroidism and euthyroid goitre.
These can be treated with thyroxine replacement.

124 Pharmacological treatments
Toxic effects occur typically at levels above 2 mmol/L, but can occur at around 1.2 mmol/L.
They include course tremor, nausea and vomiting, polydipsia and polyuria, dysarthria and ataxia,
confusion, disorientation and delirium. Patients must be informed about these effects and the
possible causes, including: dehydration secondary to diarrhoea, vomiting and excessive sweating
(in fever or hot weather); interaction with thiazide and loop-acting diuretics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and ACE inhibitors; and overdose.
Patients must be informed about the signs of lithium toxicity: tremor, nausea
and vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, slurred speech, ataxia and delirium.
Treatment of toxicity involves cessation of lithium and the restoration of fluid balance. Toxicity
can cause irreversible brain damage and impaired renal concentrating ability.
Treatment of lithium toxicity involves cessation of lithium and restoration of
fluid balance.
Lithium can cause congenital malformations, in particular, the cardiac Ebstein anomaly. Therefore,
it is usually contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Young women
of childbearing age must be informed of this risk and given contraceptive advice. Lithium is
excreted in breast milk, attaining concentrations in the infant between 0.1 and 0.5 those in the
mother.
Lithium is contraindicated in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.
Carbamazepine
It is thought that carbamazepine exerts its therapeutic effect through the inhibition of kindling,
a process whereby repeated stimuli to certain areas of the brain can cause a fall in the threshold
for response and eventually to spontaneous discharge. The drug may be prescribed to those who
cannot tolerate lithium, and in people with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder who fail to respond
to lithium.
The drug is metabolised in the liver and has a half-life of 12–24 hours. It induces its own
metabolism, so doses usually need to be increased after 2–4 weeks. Doses usually begin at 200mg
at night or 200mg twice a day and are then increased until the plasma levels recommended for
its use as an anticonvulsant are reached.
Adverse reactions
Dangerous adverse reactions are listed below.
1. Hypersensitivity reaction – This appears over the first two weeks of treatment, usually as a
rash. The drug must be ceased.
2. Bone marrow toxicity – Monitoring of the full blood picture is advisable during the first
few months of treatment.
3. Hepatic toxicity – Liver function should also be monitored. While a slight elevation in
GGT is common due to hepatic enzyme induction, the drug should be ceased if there is a
persistent elevation of liver enzymes.
At toxic levels, the drug can cause nausea, dizziness, dysarthria, diplopia and ataxia. At therapeutic
levels, sedation may be a problem, but usually wears off after a few weeks. Other side effects
include weight gain. There is an increased incidence of spina bifida if used in the first trimester
of pregnancy (incidence around 0.5 per cent). This is lower than the risk associated with sodium
valproate (incidence around 1.5 per cent).
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 125
Drug interactions limit the use of carbamazepine with many other medications. The following
drugs inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine: cimetidine, erythromycin, isoniazid, verapamil,
dextro-propoxyphene and diltiazem. Since carbamazepine can enhance its own metabolism, levels
should be checked periodically to maintain a therapeutic dose. It also increases the metabolism
and so lowers the plasma levels of oral contraceptives (leading to contraceptive failure), other
steroids, phenytoin, theophylline, warfarin, tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics.
The large number of potential drug interactions limits the use of
carbamazepine
Sodium valproate
The mode of action of sodium valproate in the treatment of mania is not known.
Valproate has a half-life of between 8 and 20 hours and so takes between two and five days to
reach steady state. Doses usually begin at 200mg bd. The anticonvulsant levels are used as a guide
to monitoring dose. There is some evidence that the use of a loading dose of valproate in the
treatment of mania reduces the amount of antipsychotic required, and may shorten the length
of the episode.
Adverse effects include nausea and vomiting, weight gain, thinning of hair, ankle swelling and
sedation. More serious adverse reactions include hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis and thrombocytopaenia.
Periodic checks of liver function and blood count are therefore recommended.
Sodium valproate should not be prescribed during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester,
because of the risk of it causing spina bifida.
Sodium valproate should not be prescribed during pregnancy, especially during
the first trimester.
Anxiolytics and hypnotics
Benzodiazepines
Benzodiazepines are used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, as hypnotics and as adjuncts to
antipsychotics in the treatment of agitated psychotic patients. They are also effective anticonvulsants
and muscle relaxants. Recognition of their propensity for tolerance and dependence has led to
greater care being taken in their prescription over recent years.
Benzodiazepines are useful adjuncts to antipsychotics in the treatment of
agitated psychotic patients.
They have their effect through increasing the inhibitory effect of gamma amino butyric acid
(GABA) on receptors in the central nervous system.
The fall in blood level and termination of action after a dose of diazepam is initially through
redistribution to fat stores. However, if the drug is taken regularly over a few weeks, removal
of the drug is by metabolism, a much slower process. Longer acting benzodiazepines include
diazepam (half-life 20–100 hours) and clonazepam. Shorter acting drugs include temazepam,
alprazolam and oxazepam. The long half-life of diazepam is due to its active metabolites.
Pharmacodynamic tolerance to the sedative effects of the drug develops within weeks. However,
tolerance to the anxiolytic effects does not seem to occur. Sudden withdrawal can lead to
agitation, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, hallucinations, delirium and seizures. Interactions occur
126 Pharmacological treatments
with other CNS depressants. Adverse effects include sedation, impaired fine motor coordination,
dysarthria, nystagmus, ataxia and memory problems. In the elderly, ataxia can lead to falls and
serious injury. Cognitive impairment may also be more severe in this group. The benzodiazepines
are much safer than the barbiturate hypno-sedatives that they replaced. However, in overdose,
death can result from respiratory depression, asphyxiation or inhalational pneumonia.
These drugs should not be prescribed to people with myasthenia gravis or severe respiratory
depression.
Indications for the use of benzodiazepines include:
•	 the short-term treatment of insomnia
•	 the treatment of insomnia over the first two weeks of treatment with an SSRI
•	 as an adjunct to antipsychotics in the treatment of an agitated psychotic patient
•	 the treatment of akathisia
•	 the treatment of alcohol withdrawal
•	 as a preanaesthetic.
Although antidepressants and benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytics, I recommend cognitive
behavioural therapy as the first line treatment of anxiety disorders (see Chapter 15). Cognitive
behavioural therapy is at least as effective as pharmacotherapy; it is non-toxic, non-addictive and
is associated with lower relapse rates than pharmacotherapy. However, at times, a combination
of both approaches is required.
Zolpidem
Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine that is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia in adults.
It selectively binds to the omega-1 (benzodiazepine-1) receptor, part of the GABAA receptor
complex, but is chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines. The usual dose is 10mg at night; 5 mg
in elderly debilitated patients and those with hepatic impairment. The most common adverse
effects are dizziness, nausea, drowsiness and diarrhoea. It has a short elimination half-life of
around 2.4 hours with a duration of action up to six hours1
.
Zopiclone
Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone agent that is an agonist at GABAA receptors. It is used for the
short-term treatment of insomnia. Usual doses are between 7.5mg and 15mg at night; 3.75 mg
in the elderly and those with hepatic impairment. Side effects include bitter aftertaste and, more
rarely, dry mouth, daytime sleepiness and nightmares2

Depression
Around 10 per cent of people presenting to general practitioners suffer from depression. Making
a diagnosis is often difficult because mixed depression and anxiety occurs more frequently than
depression or anxiety alone, and people often present with somatic rather than psychological
symptoms. General practitioners see people with disorders across the broad spectrum of
depressive illness from the milder forms through to severe melancholia and psychotic depression.
The high prevalence ‘minor’ depressive syndromes, though not containing florid symptoms,
are nevertheless associated with substantial disability and handicap, higher than that associated
with most physical disorders1
. Moreover, because of their high prevalence, the overall economic
burden of these disorders on the community is substantial.
This chapter covers the assessment and treatment of depression and post-partum disorders.
Chapter 15 deals with the treatment of anxiety disorders. See Appendix 11 for a discussion of
sleep disturbance, a common presentation in general practice.
Assessment
People use a variety of words to describe depression—feeling down in the dumps, sad, despondent,
gloomy, bored or out of sorts. In some, especially adolescents and children, the predominant
mood is irritability. An essential feature of the more serious depressive syndromes is anhedonia,
the loss of pleasure or interest in almost all activities. Assess anhedonia by first asking a (man)
about his usual interests and activities. Then ask if he is getting as much pleasure as usual from
them. Ask him when he last did something he really enjoyed.
An essential feature of serious depression is anhedonia, the loss of pleasure or
interest in almost all activities.
Neurovegetative symptoms of depression include loss of appetite, insomnia (especially early
morning wakening), diurnal mood variation (in which the person feels most depressed in the
morning with improvement in mood as the day progresses), loss of energy and motivation,
reduced libido, difficulties with concentration and memory, and psychomotor retardation or
agitation. Older sufferers may present with depressive pseudodementia.
Depressed people often experience feelings of hopelessness, i.e. that they have no future. Ask
about future plans and goals. This symptom is a stronger predictor of suicide than depressed
mood. Helplessness, the feeling that nothing and nobody can alleviate a person’s suffering, may
also be present. A person’s self esteem is lowered in depression. Depressed people are often
plagued by feelings of worthlessness and guilt. They may be preoccupied with thoughts of death
and dying. Always ask direct questions about any suicidal thoughts, intentions and plans (see
Chapter 3 for a discussion of the assessment of suicidality). In view of the frequent co-morbidity
with anxiety disorders, it is important to note the presence of panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive
symptoms and phobias.

Depression presenting with physical symptoms
Between 50 per cent and 95 per cent of those who present to their general practitioners with
depression do so with somatic rather than psychological symptoms. Common presenting
symptoms include fatigue, headache, joint pain, chest pain, myalgia, gastro-intestinal disturbance,
dizziness and weight loss.
The commonest conditions seen in general practice are mixed anxiety/
depressive disorders, often presenting with physical symptoms.
There are several possible reasons why people present in this way. Physical symptoms are features
of both depression and anxiety. People may be better able to recognise and articulate their
physical symptoms than their mental symptoms. They may believe that doctors are primarily
skilled in the treatment of physical disorders. Doctors who are uncomfortable dealing with
emotional issues, or who are pressed for time, may reinforce these attitudes. People may be
reluctant to acknowledge mental symptoms because of the stigma of mental illness. They may
be unaware that effective treatments exist for these conditions.
The SPHERE-GP is a self-report questionnaire that is useful in the assessment of people
presenting with a combination of somatic and psychological symptoms (see example in Appendix
1). The CES-D scale is a self-report depression scale for use in the general population1
.
Depression as a response to physical illness
Between 20 and 30 per cent of people with chronic medical conditions will suffer major
depression at some time during the course of the illness. When depression and physical illness
occur together, the prognosis for both conditions is worse. For example, depressed patients
have three and a half times the mortality of non-depressed patients in the six months following
a myocardial infarction. Depression is most likely to occur in response to the diagnosis of
chronic or life threatening disorders, or in disorders with distressing symptoms such as chronic
pain or dyspnoea. Although painful psychological responses to having a physical illness are
understandable, they need to be distinguished from major depression. In general, consider a
diagnosis of depression if symptoms are more severe or persistent than expected in a normal
grief reaction (see Chapter 7). The persistence of any of the following suggests the presence
of depression: feelings of guilt and worthlessness, anhedonia, suicidality, poor concentration,
psychomotor retardation or agitation, panic attacks, or psychotic symptoms. Be alert to somatic
symptoms that cannot be accounted for by the physical illness.
When depression and physical illness occur together, the prognosis for both
conditions is worse.
Lists of physical disorders and drugs that can cause depression can be found in Tables 17-5 and
17-7.

People at risk of depression
Table 14-1 lists some groups of people who are at increased risk of depression.
Diagnosis
The main depressive syndromes seen in general practice are adjustment disorders, dysthymia
and major depression. The prototype for these disorders, major depression, will be discussed first.
However, this is not the most prevalent condition in general practice settings. Disorders with
milder symptoms are more common. Moreover, as many as 50 per cent of people who present
to general practitioners feeling depressed have symptoms that do not meet the criteria for any
of these disorders.
As many as 50 per cent of people who present to general practitioners with
depression have symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a specific disorder.
Major depression
The essential features are persistent symptoms over at least two weeks of depressed mood or
loss of pleasure or interest (anhedonia) together with at least four of the following: change in
appetite, weight loss or weight gain, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation or
agitation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, poor concentration or
indecisiveness, recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal thoughts, plans or acts1
. In adolescents and
children the mood may be predominantly irritable.
Dysthymic disorder
This refers to a chronic low-grade depressive syndrome. The DSM-IV requires a duration of
at least two years in adults, and at least one year in children and adolescents. The symptoms are
not as severe as in major depression and, although persisting for years, may not be present every
day over that period. In particular, persistent anhedonia is not a feature. However, because of
its chronicity, high levels of disability and handicap may accompany the symptoms. It is the
commonest depressive diagnosis in children who present with chronically depressed or irritable
mood, low self-esteem and a perception of being unloved.

Adjustment disorder
Adjustment disorders are reactions that occur within three months of the onset of a stressor,
involving symptoms and levels of disability and handicap that are more than would normally
be expected. Symptoms may include marked distress, depressed mood, tearfulness, anxiety,
irritability or multiple physical complaints. Disabilities and handicaps include interpersonal
withdrawal, conduct disturbance (for example, reckless driving, fighting or truancy) and poor
work or academic performance.
Psychotic depression
Depressed people often become preoccupied with concerns about their physical health, their
finances and feelings of worthlessness and guilt. In some cases, these beliefs are delusional. There
may be nihilistic delusions (e.g. the belief that one’s internal organs are rotting or no longer exist,
or that the world is going to end), delusions of poverty, hypochondriacal delusions (e.g. that one
has cancer) or delusions of guilt. The depressed person may suffer hallucinations (e.g. voices
saying that he or she is worthless and evil). The diagnosis of psychotic depression indicates the
need for specialist referral, hospitalisation, drug treatment and often, ECT.
Bipolar disorder (manic depression)
Episodes of depression may alternate with episodes of mania. The symptoms and signs of mania
include elevated mood, grandiosity, a decreased need for sleep, pressure of speech, flight of
ideas, increased energy and activity levels, and impaired judgement. Lithium is the mainstay of
treatment. Inpatient care is usually required for the treatment of manic episodes. Psychiatric
referral is recommended. Please refer to Chapter 22 for a more detailed discussion of treatment
of psychotic illnesses.
Differential diagnosis
See Tables 17-5 and 17-7 for lists of physical disorders and substances that can cause depression.
While the apathy and poor concentration of the person with dementia may be mistaken for
depression, the two syndromes frequently co-exist, especially early in the course of dementia. As
mentioned above, depression is often co-morbid with anxiety disorders. The negative symptoms
of people with schizophrenia may be mistaken for depression. However, these people are also
prone to developing depression (see Chapter 22).
Formulation
The formulation of depression always involves contributions of biological and psychosocial
factors. While the diagnosis is an essential guide to treatment, a formulation is required for the
development of a comprehensive treatment plan. In particular, for the 50 per cent of people
whose symptoms fail to fit any of the recognised syndromes, the formulation is the principal
guide to treatment.
Biological factors
As discussed above, depression often arises in response to the stress of having a physical illness,
especially life threatening and chronic disorders, illnesses with distressing symptoms, and
conditions associated with high levels of disability and handicap. Alternatively, physical disorders
and drugs can cause depression (see Table 17-5 and Table 17-7). Have a high index of suspicion
about an organic cause of depression in an elderly person presenting for the first time with
depression. A family history of depression may suggest that genetic factors are playing a part in
the inheritance of a primary depressive disorder, especially bipolar disorder.
Life threatening and chronic disorders, illnesses with distressing symptoms,
and conditions associated with high levels of disability and handicap are often
complicated by the development of depression.
Depression
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 131
Psychosocial factors
Depression may complicate other mental disorders. The frequent co-morbidity with anxiety
disorders has already been mentioned. Between 30 and 40 per cent of people with panic disorder
or obsessive–compulsive disorder also suffer from depression. Depression may also complicate
schizophrenia, alcohol and substance abuse, dementia, somatisation disorder, chronic pain,
anorexia nervosa and bulimia. People with personality disorders are vulnerable to depression,
especially those with dependent, obsessional and narcissistic traits (see Chapter 23).
Between 30 and 40 per cent of people with panic disorder also suffer from
depression.
Psychodynamic theories may offer insight into the meaning of an individual’s response to loss.
In ‘Mourning and Melancholia’, Freud1 observed that, unlike the person going through a normal
mourning process, the person who becomes depressed following a loss suffers a critical fall in
self-esteem. The depressed person is excessively self-critical and suffers feelings of worthlessness
and guilt. In the same essay, Freud concluded that the depressed person’s anger towards a lost
person is often directed against the self.
Other psychodynamic theorists view depression as being caused by a narcissistic injury. That
is, depression occurs as a result of people not living up to the high expectations they have
of themselves. It is the difference between ideals and reality that leads to depression and the
attendant low self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness (see example in Box 14-1).
Arieti2 postulated that people prone to depression tend to subjugate their own needs and wishes
to those of another person (the dominant other) in order to gain his or her affection, attention
or approval. In other cases, a man may invest all his energies in the goals of some ideology or
organisation.
Common precipitants of depression include loss, or a failure to live up to
expectations of oneself.
Box 14-1: Psychodynamic formulation of a man with depression
A 35-year-old man had for some months been warning other residents of the block of flats where
he lived about the poor security. After a fire broke out in his flat, his fears initially seemed to have
been vindicated. Two months later, he was charged with starting the fire himself. He subsequently
became depressed. Far from being a criminal, his aim in life had always been to be on the side of law
enforcement and protection. After leaving school, he had joined the army, but was discharged after
taking an overdose of paracetamol. He later attempted unsuccessfully to join the police force. He
worked for a security firm for 18 months before a back injury forced him from the job. He had a
collection of military insignia and badges, and was proud of his acquaintance with some serving police
officers. A tragic event in his personal history was the death of his father in a car accident two weeks
before he was born.
Comment: The man’s depression results from his failure to live up to the high ideals he set for himself to
be a strong man, protector and even a hero. The origin of his high aspirations is the idealised image he
has of the father he never knew. Ironically, a desperate bid to prove himself a hero involved performing
the very sort of act that he was committed to fighting against, and has led to shame, humiliation and
guilt.

Social factors
Around 40 per cent of acute episodes of mood disorder are precipitated by stressful events. Stress
is a commoner precipitant of depression than non-adherence to medication. Perceived criticism
from a spouse is a high predictor of relapse in depression. Similarly, a high expressed emotion (EE)
at home (hostility, critical comments and enmeshment) increases the risk of relapse. A common
precipitant is loss, especially of a close relationship. A recent loss may reawaken unresolved
losses from a person’s past. The anniversary of the loss of a close relationship may precipitate
depression.
Around 40 per cent of episodes of depression have understandable precipitants.
Treatment
General principles
As a rule, the most effective treatments of depression involve a combination of pharmacological
and non-pharmacological interventions. An exception is the treatment of people with psychotic
depression or catatonia who will require drugs and possibly ECT before being accessible to
psychotherapy. At the other extreme are people with minor depression or an adjustment disorder
in whom the efficacy of drug treatments is uncertain.
The most effective treatment of depression usually involves both
pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
The two forms of treatment work together synergistically. For example, psychotherapy may
enhance the efficacy of drug treatments by addressing the meaning of a person’s non-adherence.
A depressed man may refuse to take his medication, because he believes that nothing can help
him. Another may believe that he does not deserve to get better. A third may feel too ashamed to
take medication because of the stigma of mental illness. In the following discussion, three arms
of treatment are discussed—non-specific interventions, drugs and psychotherapy.
Treatment setting
Most people suffering depression prefer to be treated at home rather than in hospital. Indications
for hospitalisation include danger to self or others, social isolation, limited social supports, poor
self-care, severe co-morbid substance abuse, psychotic symptoms and the requirement for ECT.
Non-specific interventions
The following non-specific interventions are applicable to the treatment of depression as well as
anxiety and somatoform disorders with which it is commonly associated.
Non-specific treatments of depression are also applicable to the treatment
of anxiety disorders and somatoform disorders. They include engagement in
treatment, illness education, increasing daily activities, exercise programs,
limiting excessive substance use and improving sleep habit.
Engagement in treatment
It is essential to engage the patient in the treatment plan. Summarise the person’s problems and
note that they are characteristic of the syndrome of depression. Discuss the formulation and
explain how this will guide treatment for that individual. Link the different treatment approaches
to specific aspects of the problem—the efficacy of medication in relieving some of the symptoms;
counselling and structured problem solving to address specific stressors; cognitive–behavioural
approaches to change habitual negative ways of thinking about oneself, the future and the world;
Depression
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 133
interpersonal therapy to improve social functioning; grief work to deal with losses; and marital
or family therapy to deal with relationship problems.
Illness education
Educating people about depression promotes their active involvement in treatment and addresses
any misconceptions they have about the illness. Because of the stigma attached to mental illness,
patients’ knowledge of depression is often limited and they are often reluctant to accept the
diagnosis or adhere to treatment. Some guidelines for educating the depressed patient about
depression are shown in Table 14-2.
The ‘beyondblue’ website, www.beyondblue.org.au, contains useful resources, including accounts
of personal experiences of depression, patient information leaflets, a multimedia library with
video clips, research reports and discussion-room transcripts.
Increasing daily activities
As a consequence of their loss of interest and pleasure, depressed people often withdraw from
their usual work, leisure and social activities. They often lose confidence and feel that they can
no longer do the things they used to do, or that others will not want to see them. They become
avoidant because of co-morbid anxiety symptoms. Through inactivity, they lose access to sources
of pleasure and self-esteem. A vicious cycle is created in which depression leads to avoidance,
which in turn reinforces depression. Conversely, having a wide range of interests and social
contacts helps prevent relapse.
Explain this to the patient. Ask him or her to make out a daily activity schedule for the week
that includes some pleasant activities, some duties and some social activities (see Appendix 7).
Involve the family in widening the person’s range of activities.
Table 14-2: Educating people about depression
•	 Symptoms – Explain the frequent occurrence of physical and anxiety symptoms.
•	Prevalence – The disorder is not due to some weakness of character. It has a wide prevalence in the
community.
•	Diagnosis – Explain the difference between normal sadness and depression. Depression is persistent
and includes symptoms such as anhedonia that are not normal responses to stress. Depression impairs
one’s ability to solve problems, and so may lead to an exacerbation of the stress that precipitated it.
•	Causes – Explain both the biological and psychosocial determinants of the illness. It may be useful
to explain neurotransmitter dysfunction and the role of genetics, physical illness and substance
abuse, as well as the impact of stress and personality styles.
•	Treatment – Emphasise the need for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments.
When using drug treatments, explain their mode of action, the delayed onset of action (2–8 weeks),
the need to take the medication for 6–12 months to prevent relapse, and the side effects, toxicity and
potential drug interactions. Emphasise that antidepressants are not hypnotics and are not addictive.
•	 Relapse prevention – Ask the person to monitor his or her symptoms. Clarify the early signs of
relapse in that individual.
•	Provide the person with pamphlets on depression and recommend self-help books. 1, 2

134
Exercise
A daily exercise program will reduce anxiety and improve physical health and the sleep/wake
cycle. A regular hour a day of gentle exercise, such as walking, is preferable to brief irregular
bursts of strenuous exercise.
Alcohol and drugs
Depressed and anxious people often turn to recreational drugs to alleviate their symptoms.
Explain that while rising alcohol levels may briefly improve mood, falling levels cause depression
and anxiety. Remind patients of the physical consequences of cigarette consumption and alcohol
abuse.
Sleep/wake cycle
The sleep/wake cycle is frequently disrupted in depression with initial insomnia, early morning
wakening, poor quality of sleep, and daytime fatigue and irritability. Table 14-3 contains guidelines
for improving the sleep habit.
Pharmacological treatment
Drugs are particularly effective in the treatment of neurovegetative symptoms, anhedonia,
psychomotor retardation, and psychotic phenomena such as delusions and hallucinations. They
are less effective than psychotherapy in dealing with low self-esteem, guilt, hopelessness, social
withdrawal and loss of motivation.
Drug treatments are most effective for the treatment of neurovegetative
disturbance, anhedonia, psychomotor retardation and psychotic symptoms.
Table 14-3: Guidelines for improving sleep habit
•	Establish a regular routine before going to bed (for example, use the toilet, have a shower, brush
teeth and listen to some music).
•	Go to bed at the same time every night.
•	Get up at the same time every morning. Sleeping in will only disrupt the sleep habit and make it
harder to get to sleep that night. One reason children rarely suffer sleep problems is that a regular
sleep routine is enforced by their parents.
•	Do not take naps during the day.
•	In the evening, avoid alcohol, cigarettes and other stimulants such as coffee, tea and Coca
Cola.
•	Avoid using sleeping tablets. All hypnotics disrupt sleep architecture and can cause rebound insomnia
and anxiety upon withdrawal. Tolerance to benzodiazepines develops within two to three weeks.
•	 Set aside time for regular exercise, but avoid exercising in the evening.
•	 Set aside time for problem solving during the day in order to avoid ruminating over problems
through the night.
•	Take steps to promote a comfortable, quiet and undisturbed sleep environment.
•	If you cannot get to sleep after 30 minutes, get up and leave the bedroom and do something
pleasant and relaxing, such as listening to music. Only go back to bed when you feel sleepy
•	 Only use the bed for sleeping. The only exception is sexual activity.
Depression
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 135
There are presently seven classes of antidepressants available. All share similar efficacy, but have
different side effect profiles. See Table 13-3 for a summary of their relative advantages and
disadvantages. As a first line of treatment, I recommend one of the following classes of drugs:
• selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), i.e. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram
or fluvoxamine
•	 serotonin receptor antagonists, i.e. nefazodone
•	 selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), i.e. venlafaxine
•	 reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (RIMAs), i.e. moclobemide
•	 tetracyclic antidepressants, e.g. mianserin
As a second line:
•	 tricyclic antidepressants, i.e. desipramine, nortriptyline, imipramine, dothiepin, amitryptiline,
doxepin
I would only recommend the use of irreversible inhibitors of a monoamine oxidase (i.e.
phenelzine or tranylcypromine) as a third line. It is probably best only to prescribe these drugs
on the advice of a psychiatrist.
It usually takes around two weeks before a therapeutic effect is evident. If there has been no
effect after six weeks, consider the possible reasons listed in Table 14-4. If a change of drug is
indicated, it is best to change to a member of a different class of antidepressant. Guidelines for
changing antidepressants are shown in Table 13-4. Augmentation with lithium or thyroxine may
be of benefit in treatment resistant cases. This is probably best done after consultation with a
psychiatrist.
Explain to patients that their mood symptoms will only begin to improve after
about two weeks, and that the antidepressant will need to be taken for six to
twelve months in order to prevent relapse.
Antidepressant therapy should be continued for at least 6 months, and usually 12 months, in
order to prevent relapse. Maintenance therapy may be indicated for people who have suffered
three or more episodes of depression, two episodes within five years, or severe illness.
Lithium carbonate is the drug of choice for bipolar depression and may be a useful adjuvant in
treatment-resistant unipolar depression. Electroconvulsive therapy remains the most effective
treatment for severe depressive illness and is especially effective in psychotic depression.
It is essential to educate the patient about the use of these drugs (see Table 14-2).

136
Electroconvulsive Treatment (ECT)
ECT is the most effective in the treatment for depression with psychotic symptoms and
psychomotor changes (psychomotor retardation or agitation). Indications are summarised in
Table 14-5. Pharmacological treatment is continued after the course of ECT.
Psychotherapeutic approaches to treatment
Psychotherapy for people with depression needs to be flexible, taking into account characteristics
of the individual, the formulation of the depression and the stage of the illness.
1. Crisis intervention, counselling and structured problem solving
These techniques are described in detail in Chapter 6. They are the mainstays in the
treatment of adjustment disorders. They are also used in dealing with the precipitants of
depressive disorders generally, and with crises as they occur in the lives of people with
chronic depression.
Use counselling and structured problem solving to help people deal with
stressors associated with the onset of depression.
2. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
This form of psychotherapy has proven efficacy in the treatment of mild and moderate
depression. See Chapter 10 for a more detailed description of CBT. Prefer CBT over IPT
in the treatment of people with few affectively charged events associated with the onset of
their depression. CBT is less effective in people with significant cognitive dysfunction.
CBT has proven efficacy in the treatment of mild to moderate depression.
3. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)
IPT is discussed in Chapter 11. Indications for IPT include the presence of mild, moderate
or severe depression (i.e. Hamilton Depression Scale score > 20); the presence of clear life
events around the onset of the depression; and the possession of reasonable social skills. IPT
is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of people with severe depression.
It is less effective in people who possess only limited social skills.
IPT is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of severe
depression.
4. Grief work
Grief is discussed in detail in Chapter 7. Depression is frequently precipitated by loss and
perpetuated by unresolved feelings about loss. In grief work, you encourage the expression
of thoughts and feelings toward the lost person or thing (e.g. a job) within a supportive
non-judgmental therapeutic relationship. It is especially important to identify any negative
emotions and ideas and to give the person permission to express these (e.g. anger towards
the deceased).

Depression
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 137
Grief work helps people deal with loss.
People with severe mental or physical illnesses need to mourn the losses that they suffer as
a consequence of the disorder. Depression is common after any psychotic episode. After a
manic episode a man may feel ashamed of his behaviour and have to mourn other losses
(e.g. financial) incurred as a result of impaired judgement. Also at risk are people suffering
terminal illness (e.g. HIV infection and cancer), severe disability (e.g. quadriplegia), disorders
with frightening symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea in chronic airway disease) or conditions that
require complex ongoing medical treatment (e.g. renal dialysis). A prolonged physical or
mental illness may lead to the loss of work or friends, and even family breakdown.
Grief work is an important component of interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Note, however,
that in IPT terms only bereavement is classified as grief, while other losses are seen as role
transitions (see Chapter 11).
5. Marital/family therapy
Perceived criticism by a spouse increases the risk of relapse in depression. A high level
of expressed emotion (hostility, critical comments and enmeshment) is also a predictor of
relapse. Marital conflict or the loss of a close relationship may be the precipitant of a person’s
depression. The pattern of a maladaptive relationship from the past may re-emerge in a
person’s current marital relationship. These issues can be dealt with in therapy.
Address family and marital problems in joint therapy with the person’s spouse
or other intimate.
However, you should be cautious when dealing with long standing patterns of interaction
within families. In some cases, a person’s symptoms and disabilities may come to play a part in
maintaining equilibrium in the family system. A sudden change will have an impact on other
members of the family and on the family system as a whole. An example of depression occurring
in the context of marital problems is given in Box 14-2.
Box 14-2: Depression in the context of marital problems
Example: A 60-year-old man presents to you with a three-month history of depression. Last year, he
retired from his job as a ship’s engineer. You have been treating him for the past month with sertraline
100mg in the morning, but he has shown little improvement. He has been contemplating suicide since
his wife announced last week that she wants a trial separation. She has become exasperated with his
constant need for reassurance, and feels manipulated by his recent talk about suicide. She also feels
guilty about wanting to leave him, but sees no other option at the moment. You have also begun to
feel frustrated by his failure to get better.
Comment: Reflecting on your countertransference, you gain some understanding of how his wife must
be feeling. In particular, you can understand some of the negative reactions. These may, in turn, be
exacerbating the problem. You arrange to see the couple together.
The precipitant seems to be the marital problems that have emerged since he retired last year. His job
used to take him away from home for around six months of the year—now, he spends all of his time
at home. His retirement, though a normal developmental step, is itself a significant stressor.
You encourage him to find new interests outside the home, educate his wife about the nature of
his illness, and help them both understand the consequences of some of the maladaptive patterns of
behaviour that are associated with his illness. While being concerned for his safety, his wife cannot
be totally responsible for him and should not feel guilty about this. He needs to understand how his
behaviour, though motivated by a desire to keep her close, may be having the opposite effect.
138
6. Dynamically-informed treatment
The success of any therapy will depend on the establishment of a therapeutic alliance. Listen
to the person and empathise with how he or she feels. Acknowledge his or her suffering.
Avoid bland reassurance, such as saying, ‘But you have no reason to feel depressed’. This may
be perceived as unempathic and rejecting. Empathy will also help you to work with the
person in formulating the reasons why he or she has developed depression and what steps
need to be taken to overcome it.
Having established a therapeutic alliance, the person will begin to transfer on to you feelings
and attitudes held towards significant others in his or her life. For example, a dependent
man may expect you to give him advice about how to solve his problems. Avoid repeating
the patterns of his previous relationships. Instead, use the principles of counselling and
structured problem solving to help him make decisions for himself.
Other countertransference responses that are commonly experienced when treating people
with depression include frustration and anger when a person fails to improve, boredom with
a person’s many complaints, guilt and helplessness that you cannot solve the problem, denial
of the seriousness of suicidal behaviour, or an impulse to rescue them (see example in Box
14- 3). These reactions give you insight into how others in the person’s life feel. In some
cases, the responses of others may be exacerbating the depression. For example, some people
who fail to improve seem to get a perverse pleasure out of your and their families’ inability
to help. The sadistic wish to hurt others by making them feel anxious, guilty and de-skilled
is sometimes the other side of masochistic self-denigration. In such a case, the limits of what
you and the person’s carers can do should also be acknowledged.
Countertransference reactions that can interfere with the treatment of
depression include frustration, boredom, guilt, helplessness and impulses to
rescue or to give inappropriate advice.
Monitoring progress
Ask the person to monitor changes in his or her symptoms and any side effects of medication
over the course of treatment. The SPHERE Patient Treatment Pack1 contains forms for this
purpose. The SPHERE-GP2 instrument can be used to monitor progress weekly over the first
four weeks and then at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks (see Appendix 1).
Box 14-3: Transference and countertransference in depression
A 40-year-old man becomes depressed after his wife leaves him, taking their children with her. She has
always been responsible for making the major family decisions. He would never state his views directly,
even when he was against a particular decision. Despite several attempts, he has never managed to get
his motor vehicle licence. His wife was scornful of his failure and eventually decided that they could
not afford to pay for any more driving lessons or tests. In therapy, he expresses his helplessness and wish
for you to tell him what to do.
Comment: You resist the pressure to give him advice on what he should do. In doing so you avoid
repeating the pattern of the relationship with his wife, the ‘dominant other’. Instead, you teach him
structured problem solving strategies to help him find solutions to his problems himself

Indications for specialist referral
Some indications for referral to a psychiatrist are shown in Table 14-6. Referral to a psychologist
or other expert in CBT may be indicated for persistent mild to moderate depression.
Post-partum disorders
The three main syndromes are post-partum blues, postnatal depression and puerperal psychosis.
Post-partum blues is a transient, self-limiting condition lasting hours to days. It is a common
problem with a prevalence estimated at between 50 per cent and 70 per cent. It will not be
discussed further here. Postnatal depression is a depressive syndrome with an onset in the postnatal
period, that is, up to six months following childbirth. A depressive illness with an onset later
than six months is best described simply as major depression. Puerperal psychosis is a psychiatric
emergency with an onset during the first month after childbirth. It is rare with a prevalence of
around 0.1 per cent.
Postnatal depression
Diagnostic assessment
Most general practitioners will routinely screen for depression in all new mothers. A useful
instrument is the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (Appendix 11). In the clinical
assessment, ask about the symptoms of depression—depressed or irritable mood, anhedonia,
vegetative function change, anxiety symptoms, suicidality, helplessness and hopelessness. Note
any persistence of symptoms of the ‘blues’. Observe any problems the mother has dealing with
the baby—for example, not wanting to hold the child, feeling detached from or irritable with
the child, or having persistent difficulties feeding him or her. Frequent attendance at the practice
may indicate that the mother is having difficulty coping. Consider maternal depression if the
baby has a difficult temperament, or has bad colic or reflux. Having made a diagnosis, make a
formulation.
Indicators of postnatal depression include depressed or irritable mood,
neurovegetative function change, persistence of the ‘blues’, problems coping
with the baby and frequent medical consultations.
Formulation
Biological factors predisposing to postnatal depression include a family history of mood disorder,
a past history of mood disorder, a history of pre-menstrual syndrome, previous birth related
crises, and complications of the birth or of drug treatments.
Psychological factors include a vulnerable personality, the presence of depression during
pregnancy and a past history of postnatal depression or anxiety. Social factors include relationship
problems with the husband or the mother’s parents. Assess the level of social support. Note any
associated stressful life events (e.g. the need to give up a job, moving house or illness in the
family).
Table 14-6: Indications for referral to a psychiatrist
•	 psychotic depression
•	 bipolar disorder
•	 suicidality
•	 severe post-partum disorder
•	 severe personality disorder
•	 complex drug therapy
•	 poor response to treatment
•	 if, for any other reason, you lack confidence in treating a particular individual
140
Take note, also, of factors relating to the pregnancy itself. These include depression, unplanned or
unwanted pregnancy, obstetric complications, birth of a handicapped child or the birth process
not proceeding according to expectations.
Treatment
Education
Education about post-partum disorders before childbirth is a useful preventive strategy. For the
woman who is suffering from postnatal depression, explanation about the disorder will provide
relief in itself. Cognitive distortions typical of depression should also be corrected. For example,
the mother may feel that she is a bad mother, that she is a failure, or that she is going insane. It
is important to inform women who are suffering postnatal depression that the condition is not
uncommon, that they are not alone in feeling this way and that it is not due to a failure on their
part. Making it clear that the condition is understood and that effective treatments are available
will reduce anxiety and helplessness.
Psychotherapeutic approaches
General supportive measures should be used. Allow her to ventilate her feelings. In particular,
help her to acknowledge negative feelings about the birth of the baby. Point out that these
negative feelings are not uncommon. Be careful, however, not to underrate her suffering and
assess any potential for abuse of the child. Also, allow her to discuss any problems in the marriage
or in the relationship with her parents. The birth may have necessitated role changes or a loss
of work. In helping her to deal with practical issues, use structured problem solving rather
than giving her advice on what she should do. Consider the use of specific techniques, such as
cognitive behavioural therapy (see Chapter 10).
Medication
Indications for the use of medication include severe depression, vegetative function disturbance,
psychomotor agitation or retardation, and co-morbid panic disorder. In choosing an antidepressant
drug remember that there is little information presently about the safety of the newer drugs
(SSRIs and RIMAs) for mothers who are breast-feeding. However, at the time of writing, a
number of specialists in the area are prescribing sertraline to breast-feeding mothers with postpartum depression. The amount of tricyclics that appear in breast milk is not harmful.
Referral
Consider referral to appropriate community agencies. These might include Relationships
Australia, Family Day Care and Community Child Health Nurses. Indications for referral to a
psychiatrist include persistent suicidal ideation, poor response to treatment and severe personality
problems.
Puerperal psychosis
This is a psychiatric emergency and requires specialist inpatient psychiatric care, preferably
in a unit that will house both mother and baby. The disorder may present with psychotic
symptoms (auditory hallucinations and delusions), mood lability (between depression, elation
and irritability) or features suggestive of an organic disorder (confusion, incoherence). Suicidal
ideation and ideas of harming the baby are not uncommon. In one study, five per cent of
patients ultimately committed suicide, and there was a probable infanticide rate of four per
cent1
. Women who suffer the disorder may go on to develop schizophrenia or bipolar mood
disorder. Consider medical conditions in the differential diagnosis (e.g. septicaemia, toxaemia,
hypothyroidism, Cushing’s Disease or neoplasm).

Anxiety disorders
In contrast to fear, which is the response to a realistic and immediate danger, anxiety is a
fearful response occurring in the absence of a specific danger, or in anticipation of imminent
problems or challenges. In the face of an imminent threat to life, fear is adaptive and prepares
us for ‘fight or flight’. A degree of arousal and anxiety improves performance, but high levels
of anxiety diminish performance and can lead to decompensation (see Figure 6-1). Anxiety is
only pathological when it is excessive in relation to the threat, persistent, and causes significant
disability and handicap.
The National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing found that anxiety disorders were the
most common form of mental disorder in the population with a one-year prevalence of 9.7 per
cent1
. Mixed anxiety and depression is more common than any specific disorder alone. Table
15-1 lists some of the symptoms of anxiety. Between 50 and 95 per cent of people with anxiety
disorders present with physical symptoms.
Assessment
Many of the physical symptoms of anxiety are caused by hyperventilation. Over-breathing
causes a lowering of pCO2, which in turn produces an increase in pH. The elevated pH causes
vasoconstriction in cerebral arteries and increased binding of oxygen to haemoglobin, which in
turn leads to cerebral hypoxia.

The non-specific approaches used in the treatment of depression are also applicable to the
treatment of anxiety disorders. They include education, the use of daily activity schedules, taking
regular exercise, limiting the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol and improving the sleep/
wake cycle (see Chapter 14). Cognitive and behavioural therapies are the mainstays of treatment.
Benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytics, but impair performance and can lead to dependence.
The non-specific approaches used in the treatment of depression are also
important elements in the treatment of anxiety disorders—patient education,
daily activity schedules, exercise programs, limiting cigarette and alcohol
consumption and improving sleep habit.
An excellent reference for the treatment of anxiety disorders is ‘Management of Mental Disorders,
Volume 1’1
. This volume contains detailed descriptions of treatments, as well as handouts for
patients. See Appendix 11 for a discussion of the management of sleep disturbance, a common
presentation in general practice.
Differential diagnosis
Some physical disorders and substances that can cause anxiety are listed in Tables 17-6 and
17-8. Anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks, phobias, obsessions and compulsions commonly
occur in major depression. People with psychotic disorders may suffer anxiety symptoms as part
of their disorder (e.g. obsessive–compulsive symptoms in a man with schizophrenia), in which
case the diagnosis of psychosis subsumes the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. However, people
with psychosis may also develop anxiety symptoms secondary to their psychosis (e.g. the man
who develops agoraphobia in response to his persecutory delusions).
Formulation
Biological factors
There is an increased incidence of panic disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorder among
first-degree relatives of sufferers, and concordance rates for monozygotic twins are higher than
for dizygotic twins. Some physical disorders and drugs that can cause anxiety are listed in Tables
17-6 and 17-8.
Behavioural theories
Classical conditioning may explain the development of phobias and obsessions. Operant
conditioning may account for phobic avoidance and compulsions (see Box 15-1). Children may
learn anxiety by modelling their behaviour on that of a parent.
Psychodynamic theories
Psychodynamic theories are often useful in understanding the meaning of anxiety to an individual.
In his later theories, Freud understood anxiety as a signal of danger when unconscious sexual
and aggressive drives that are in conflict with the dictates of the superego threaten to overcome
the repression imposed by the ego and enter consciousness. In some cases, secondary defences
are then mobilised, which lead to the development of characteristic neurotic symptoms. Freud
described four types of anxiety, classified according to their developmental origins. Superego
anxiety is a fear of feeling guilty or ashamed. Castration anxiety, which is manifest by fears of
retribution, is thought to arise from unresolved conflict during the Oedipal stage of development.
Separation anxiety is the fear of losing the love and care of important other people. The most
primitive form of anxiety is id anxiety, a fear of disintegration or persecution.

Other psychosocial factors
Anxiety is frequently co-morbid with other mental disorders. Anxiety symptoms commonly
occur in combination with depression. For example, between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of
people with panic disorder or obsessive–compulsive disorder also suffer depression. Anxiety
symptoms may also complicate schizophrenia, somatoform disorders, dementia and delirium.
Anxiety disorders are often complicated by self-medication with alcohol and other substances.
Conversely, substance abuse may be complicated by the development of anxiety symptoms.
Anxiety disorders are often co-morbid with depression and substance abuse.
Dependent, avoidant and obsessive–compulsive personality traits predispose to the development
of anxiety disorders. A history of school refusal may indicate a predisposition to anxiety. As with
other mental disorders, the onset of an anxiety disorder is often precipitated by life events. The
precipitant may have particular meaning for the person in terms of his of her history. A failure
to formulate a case may lead to inadequate treatment (see Box 15-2).
Generalised anxiety disorder
Generalised anxiety disorder was first defined as a residual entity in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-II) in 1980. Since then, the criteria have been refined and
field studies have demonstrated the validity of the category. In the recent National Survey of
Mental Health and Wellbeing, it had a prevalence of 3.1 per cent in the adult population, second
only in frequency to post-traumatic stress disorder1
. It is frequently co-morbid with depression
and other anxiety disorders.
Generalised anxiety disorder is a common presentation in general practice.
Box 15-1: Learning theory and the causes of anxiety disorders
Classical conditioning
•	 Sam, an eight-year-old boy develops a phobia of dogs after being bailed up by the neighbours’
Alsatian.
•	Judith suffered an embarrassing incident when her mind went blank and she froze while giving
a thank you speech at her local church. Since then, she has been increasingly anxious at social
functions.
Operant conditioning
•	Judith has begun to avoid social functions. By preventing exposure to anxious social situations, her
avoidance behaviour is negatively reinforced.
•	Vera gains relief from her obsessive fears of contamination by repeatedly washing her hands. The
relief from anxiety reinforces her compulsive behaviour.

of pharmacological treatment and a course of exposure with response prevention. Her symptoms

marital problems.

144
The main feature is excessive anxiety and worry for most days over a period of at least six
months. Associated symptoms include restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating
or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension and sleep disturbance.
Differential diagnosis
Generalised anxiety disorder is the closest disorder to normal anxiety, from which it is
distinguished by the following: the worries in GAD are difficult to control and cause significant
disability and handicap; they are more pervasive, severe and chronic, and may occur without any
precipitant; and they are accompanied by a variety of physical symptoms (fatigue, irritability,
restlessness and feeling on edge). Physical disorders and substances that can cause anxiety are
listed in Tables 17-6 and 17-8. Especially common are caffeine intoxication, sedative and alcohol
withdrawal, and stimulant abuse. Anxiety symptoms are common in depression, and may also
arise in the context of psychotic disorders.
Treatment
1. Non-specific treatments as for depression – daily activity schedules, exercise program and
improving the sleep habit (see Chapter 14)
2. Educate the patient about the following:
a) Normal anxiety, the ‘fight or flight’ response, the physical symptoms of anxiety and their
relationship to hyperventilation – People with anxiety disorders are not always aware of
some of their symptoms. For example, a man may present with fatigue, but only upon
reflection and after self-monitoring, recognise his muscle tension. People will be relieved
to understand the origins of their symptoms and feel more in control of them. Careful
and thorough explanation alone will often lead to symptomatic improvement.
b) The need to confront rather than avoid feared situations and so prevent the development
of agoraphobia
c) The dangers of becoming dependent on alcohol or benzodiazepines
3. Relaxation training:
•	 controlled breathing (see Appendix 4)
•	 progressive muscular relaxation (see Appendix 5)
•	 self-hypnosis (see Appendix 6)
4. Problem solving to deal with current stressors (see Appendix 3)
5. Cognitive-behavioural approaches to self-monitor for symptoms and to identify and
challenge automatic thoughts (see Chapter 10)
6. Referral is indicated for people with severe and chronic symptoms that do not respond to
the above psychological treatments. In some, medication may be indicated. Benzodiazepines
may be used for the short-term treatment of symptoms, antidepressants (and occasionally
benzodiazepines) for chronic symptoms. Patients prescribed benzodiazepines must be
informed about side effects and the dangers of developing tolerance, dependence and
withdrawal.
7. Evaluation of the outcome of treatment using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist1
.

Anxiety disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 145
Panic disorder
The diagnosis of panic disorder is made when a person suffers recurrent panic attacks that
cause significant distress or disability. In a panic attack, there is an abrupt onset of intense fear.
The fear may be of losing control, of going mad or of dying. Associated symptoms include
palpitations, sweating, shaking, chest discomfort, nausea, dizziness, light-headedness, derealisation,
depersonalisation, paraesthesias and hot or cold flushes.
Differential diagnosis
In the differential diagnosis, it is important to assess whether the panic attacks are occurring in
the context of a major depressive disorder. A variety of medical disorders may also cause panic
attacks. These include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and cardiac arrhythmias. Panic
attacks can also be caused by intoxication with amphetamines, cocaine or caffeine. Lists of
physical illnesses and drugs that can cause anxiety are provided in Tables 17-6 and 17-8. Other
disorders in the differential diagnosis include hypochondriasis, psychotic disorders and other
anxiety disorders.
Treatment
 1. Non-specific treatments, as for depression (see Chapter 14)
 2. Education about anxiety as above for generalised anxiety disorder
 3. Controlled breathing techniques to abort panic attacks (see Appendix 4)
 4. Relaxation techniques to prevent panic attacks – Commonly used methods are progressive
muscular relaxation (see Appendix 5) and self-hypnosis (see Appendix 6).
 5. The use of tricyclic antidepressants or SSRIs when the above measures have not been
effective on their own.
 6. The avoidance of substance abuse to self-treat symptoms (especially alcohol and
benzodiazepines).
 7. Evaluation of the outcomes of treatment:
a) Ask the person to record the frequency of panic attacks.
b) Use the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL)1
.
Agoraphobia
The essential feature of this disorder is a fear of being in places or situations from which escape
is difficult. As a consequence, sufferers often avoid the feared situations. Typical agoraphobic
fears include being away from home alone, being in a crowd, standing in line or travelling on
public transport. Agoraphobia often complicates panic disorder. The avoidance behaviour may
constitute a high level of disability.
Agoraphobia commonly complicates panic disorder.
Treatment
1. Non-specific treatments as for depression (see Chapter 14)
2. Education – As in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder, sufferers of agoraphobia
should be taught to recognise and understand their anxiety symptoms. They also need
1

(HSCL): A self-report symptom inventory. Behavioural Science, 1974, 19: 1-15.
146
to understand how avoidance behaviours can be self-perpetuating. By lowering anxiety
levels, avoidance behaviours are negatively reinforced. Avoidance of one situation can lead
to avoidance of others with consequent higher levels of disability. A person’s tolerance of
anxiety will diminish as she or he avoids facing more and more feared situations. He or she
should also be advised of the dangers of using alcohol or benzodiazepines to cope with
anxiety.
3. Relaxation techniques – controlled breathing, progressive muscular relaxation and selfhypnosis (see Appendices 4, 5 and 6)
4. Graded exposure – This involves graded exposure to a hierarchy of feared situations (see
Appendix 8). The two relaxation techniques discussed above should first be mastered. The
person is then asked to make a list of feared situations and put them in order from least to
most feared. He or she is then encouraged to work step-by-step through the list, confronting
the situations using controlled breathing and muscular relaxation before each challenge,
and using controlled breathing and selective muscle relaxation to manage anxiety during
exposure. It is essential that the person stay in the situation until the anxiety has attenuated
(habituation). Escape from the situation will only reinforce the avoidance behaviour. The
treatment is time-consuming, often requiring around an hour a day over a month. The
Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) can be used to document habituation of anxiety
during exposure (see Figure 9-2) and desensitisation over repeated exposures (see Figure
9-3).
5. Evaluation of the outcome of treatment using the Fear Questionnaire1 or the Hopkins
Symptom Checklist2
6. Referral to a psychiatrist, psychologist or specialist anxiety disorders unit if these measures
fail.
Specific phobia
This involves marked and persistent fear when exposed to specific objects or situations—for
example, animals, flying, heights, receiving an injection or seeing blood. Avoidance behaviour
can lead to significant disability.
Treatment
This is similar in principle to the treatment of agoraphobia.
1. Education about anxiety (as for panic disorder and agoraphobia, above)
2. Relaxation techniques:
•	 controlled breathing (see Appendix 4)
•	 progressive muscular relaxation (see Appendix 5)
•	 self-hypnosis (see Appendix 6)
3. Graded exposure to the feared object or situation – For example, a person suffering a
bird phobia might progress from looking at a picture of a bird, to making a visit to the
Currumbin Bird Sanctuary.
4. Avoidance of the use of benzodiazepines and alcohol to cope with feared situations

(HSCL): A self-report symptom inventory. Behavioural Science, 1974, 19:1-15.
Anxiety disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 147
5. Evaluation of the outcome of treatment by asking the person to rate his or her level of
anxiety when exposed to the feared situation using a SUDS score (see Figure 9-1).
People with blood or injection phobias are at risk of fainting during medical procedures. An
initial fight or flight response, mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, is followed by an
intense parasympathetic discharge, resulting in lowered cerebral perfusion. Make sure the person
is lying down before performing any procedures.
Social phobia
This disorder is characterised by marked and persistent fear when in the presence of unfamiliar
people or when under the scrutiny of others. Specifically, the person fears shame or humiliation.
Typical feared situations include eating, writing or having to speak in public, or being in a social
situation where she or he may do or say something embarrassing. Panic attacks may occur
during exposure. Avoidance behaviours can lead to significant disability.
Treatment
This is similar to the treatment of specific phobia. There is some evidence that antidepressant
medication may also help—moclobemide, fluoxetine or phenelzine. Propanolol may be used for
symptoms of performance anxiety that suggest sympathetic overactivity (10–40mg taken 30 to
60 minutes prior to the performance). It should not be used in those with asthma1
.
People with social phobia are anxious in the presence of unfamiliar people or
when they are under the scrutiny of others.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder
Symptoms include obsessions, that is, persistent and intrusive thoughts, impulses or images that
the person attempts to ignore or suppress; and/or compulsions, that is, repetitive behaviours (e.g.
hand washing, counting and checking) that are performed either in response to an obsession or
according to rigid rules, in order to prevent some dreaded event. Typical obsessions include fears
of contamination, doubting (e.g. a fear of having harmed others or of having left an electrical
appliance switched on), a need to have things in a particular order (e.g. when hanging out clothes
on the washing line) or fears of doing something terrible (e.g. assaulting someone). Compulsive
behaviours are recognised, at least initially, to be excessive and not realistically connected with
the situation that they are supposed to prevent. Disability results from the time spent on the
compulsions, and through their interference with other activities.
Differential diagnosis
Tourette’s disorder and temporal lobe disorders may be complicated by obsessive–compulsive
disorder. Obsessive–compulsive symptoms may be the presenting complaint in people with
depression. People with schizophrenia may suffer obsessions and compulsions in addition to
their psychotic symptoms, or when their psychotic symptoms are in remission.
Treatment
1. Education
a) about the disorder and its symptoms
b) about how compulsive rituals are reinforced by causing a reduction in anxiety – For
example, a woman who has obsessional fears of contamination experiences mounting
1Victorian Drug Usage Advisory Committee. Psychotropic Drug Guidelines, 3rd edition, North Melbourne,
Victoria, Victorian Medical Postgraduate Foundation Therapeutics Committee. 1995.
148
anxiety until she washes her hands 10 times according to her ritual. Performance of
the ritual reduces her anxiety and so is negatively reinforced and begins to occur more
frequently. Left untreated, the rituals begin to be used to neutralise anxiety in situations
in which the possibility of contamination is more and more remote. The rituals become
progressively more elaborate, time-consuming and rigid in their application. The
increasing demands of performing the rituals lead to considerable disability. Treatment
seeks to reverse this process by graded exposure to feared situations as described below.
2. Exposure with response prevention – The person is asked to list situations that trigger the
rituals. These situations are then rated according to how much anxiety each produces. The
person is then asked to confront each situation in order from least feared to most feared,
without performing the ritual. The person is instructed to stay in the situation until the
anxiety attenuates (habituation). He or she documents desensitisation by recording levels of
anxiety using a SUDS score (see Figure 9-1).
A core component of the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder
is exposure of the person to the feared situation, while preventing the
performance of the associated ritual.
3. The use of drugs that inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin, i.e. SSRIs or clomipramine.
Drugs that inhibit the re-uptake of serotonin are effective in the treatment of
obsessive–compulsive disorder.
4. Evaluate the outcome of treatment using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist1
 or the Padua
Inventory2
.
Some people will respond well to a detailed explanation of their symptoms alone. It is generally
not useful to repeatedly reassure sufferers that their obsessional fears are unrealistic. It is more
effective for them to prove this for themselves. Exposure and response prevention is often very
time-consuming and may be quite ineffective if performed in a haphazard manner. For example,
it may take two hours for the anxiety to attenuate in the first session of exposure. General
practitioners are advised to refer people who require complex treatment to a psychiatrist,
psychologist or a specialist Anxiety Disorders Unit.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
A surprising finding of the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing was that PTSD
was the commonest anxiety disorder, with a prevalence amongst the adult population of 3.3
per cent3
. PTSD may develop following a horrifying or terrifying event (e.g. rape, assault)
and is characterised by intrusive recollections (e.g. nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts),
avoidance of reminders of the event and increased arousal (e.g. insomnia, irritability, jumpiness
and anger). The impact of trauma on a person will depend on the vulnerabilities and strengths
of the individual concerned. A particular traumatic event may resonate with conflicts from the
person’s past, some of which may have been repressed (see Box 15-3).

Severe trauma can produce symptoms in the strongest of personalities. Traumatic events can
endure and change personality. For instance, abuse suffered as a child may be an important
factor in the origin of borderline personality disorder. Even adults who suffer severe trauma
can undergo personality change as a result of their chronic post-traumatic symptoms. Treatment
involves both drugs (imipramine or SSRIs) and psychotherapy. Specialist referral is indicated for
severe or long-standing cases. The essential role of the general practitioner is to be aware of the
risk of developing a psychiatric disorder in those who have suffered trauma, to observe them
over the long term and to provide early intervention if necessary. (See also Chapter 21 for a
more detailed discussion of dissociative disorders and other post-traumatic syndromes, including
post-traumatic stress disorder).

The relationship between physical and mental illness
Unravelling the extent to which physical and mental disorders are contributing to a person’s
presenting problems is a common challenge facing a general practitioner. The SPHERE GP1
instrument can be of assistance (see Appendix 1). This chapter contains an overview of the
relationships that can exist between physical and mental disorders. It concludes with a discussion
of the importance of monitoring transference and countertransference responses when treating
patients in general medical settings. It serves as an introduction to the following three chapters
in which I discuss the assessment and treatment of organic mental disorders, substance abuse and
somatoform disorders.
Psychiatric symptoms that occur in response to having a physical
illness
Physical disorders, especially chronic or terminal illnesses and those with severe symptoms and
high levels of disability and handicap, may precipitate mental disorder. These physical disorders
include HIV infection, cancer, burns, chronic airway disease, chronic renal failure (especially
during dialysis), mastectomy and other disfiguring surgery. While the development of depression
and anxiety disorders in response to these illnesses may be understandable, these responses are
not normal and they require treatment. Initial treatment may involve grief counselling to deal
with the issues of loss (see Chapter 7). However, between 20 and 30 per cent of people with
chronic physical illnesses develop major depression and require pharmacological treatment.
While the development of depression and anxiety disorders in response to
suffering a physical illness may be understandable, these responses are not
normal and they require treatment.
The assessment of depression in the context of a physical disorder is difficult because some of the
symptoms could be caused by either condition (e.g. fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of weight and
low energy levels). Take note of symptoms that cannot be accounted for by the physical disorder.
Remember that people who are depressed may present with an exacerbation of their physical
symptoms. Always consider a diagnosis of depression when any of the following symptoms are
present: persistent feelings of worthlessness and guilt, anhedonia, hopelessness, suicidality, panic
attacks, or psychomotor retardation or agitation.
Physical disorders that can cause psychological symptoms
Any organic disorder or substance that directly or indirectly affects the central nervous system
can cause psychological symptoms (see Chapter 17). These symptoms include not only the
cognitive changes of delirium and dementia, but also any of the other abnormalities found on
the mental status examination. Organic disorders remain at the top of the diagnostic hierarchy
and must be considered in all people who present with psychological symptoms.
You should have an especially high index of suspicion in elderly people who are being treated
for physical problems, or who present for the first time with psychiatric symptoms. Perform

a careful mental status examination with particular emphasis on the assessment of cognitive
function. Note any physical symptoms, prescribed medications and recreational drug use. Follow
up with relevant physical examination and investigations.
Have a high index of suspicion about an organic cause in the elderly person
who presents for the first time with mental health problems.
Mental disorders that present with physical symptoms
In general practice populations, depression and anxiety disorders commonly present with
physical symptoms (see Chapters 14 and 15). The primary somatoform disorders include
hypochondriasis and the syndromes of unexplained physical complaints—somatisation, pain
disorder and the prolonged fatigue syndromes (see Chapter 19). People with psychotic illnesses
may also present with physical complaints. For example, a man with psychotic depression may
present with hypochondriacal delusions (e.g. the conviction that his bowel is rotting). A man
with schizophrenia may suffer somatic passivity (e.g. the belief that his back pain is caused by
laser beams from a television station on Mount Coot-tha).
In general practice populations, depression and anxiety disorders often present
with physical symptoms.
Physical illness that occurs indirectly as a result of having a
mental illness
People with chronic schizophrenia or alcoholism have an increased risk of various physical
disorders associated with poor self-care (e.g. pneumonia, smoking-related diseases, diverticulitis,
poor dental health, subdural haematoma and scabies). These people may not bother to present
for help. If they do, they may have trouble describing their symptoms and be poorly adherent to
treatment. Negative attitudes of medical staff may mean that they receive sub-optimal care.
People with chronic mental illnesses often suffer poor physical health.
Transference and countertransference
Like the treatment of mental health problems, the treatment of physical illnesses can arouse
strong feelings in the doctor—anxiety, frustration, anger, sadness, hopelessness and helplessness1
.
It is normal to experience these emotions. However, in order to prevent acting inappropriately
upon them it is essential to monitor and acknowledge them. Inappropriate behaviours include
avoiding the patient or his family, making desperate efforts to rescue a patient, failing to convey
accurate information about the illness and its prognosis to the patient and his or her family, and
getting into conflict with other professionals involved in the person’s treatment.
Origin of countertransference responses
Factors to do with the patient, the doctor and the illness may predispose to difficult
countertransference responses.
Coping with chronic, severe or terminal illness places the patient, the family and the treating
doctor under stress. The doctor may have difficulty coping with the patient and family’s

transference responses. Chronic illnesses, which follow a progressive downhill course, may
engender feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and frustration in patients and in those treating
them (see also Chapter 7 for a discussion of bereavement and breaking bad news). Illnesses in
which the prognosis and treatment options are unclear will test the doctor’s ability to tolerate
uncertainty and ambiguity.
It is difficult for doctors to maintain a professional distance and think clearly about clinical
problems when treating certain individuals—people similar to themselves (especially other
doctors), patients who remind them of others who are important in their lives (e.g. their children,
spouse or parents), patients they have known for a long time, and people in the public eye. The
powerful countertransference reactions engendered by patients with personality disorders may
affect the doctor’s treatment behaviour (see Chapter 23).
The judgement of doctors who are depressed, abusing substances, under stress or suffering
burnout is impaired. Traits that are adaptive in some situations can lead to difficulties in others—a
doctor’s perfectionist qualities may make it difficult for (him) to acknowledge the limitations
of what can be done and lead him to undertake desperate measures in an attempt to rescue
patients; he may have difficulty tolerating uncertainty in the prognosis and choice of treatment;
he may isolate affect and fail to recognise his emotional reactions and how they are affecting his
behaviour. Doctors may resent the demands placed on them by severely ill patients and their
families, and have difficulty responding to criticism of their treatment.
Dealing with negative feelings
Monitor your feelings and reflect on your behaviour towards patients, noting especially any
tendency to distance oneself from the patient or, on the other hand, to being overly concerned.
Acknowledge these feelings. Label them and discuss them with a colleague. This will allow you
to take a step back, reflect on how they are affecting your behaviour towards the patient and his
or her family, and prevent acting out in the countertransference in ways that are unethical and
compromise treatment.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 155
Organic mental disorders
This chapter deals with the assessment and treatment of delirium, dementia and other mental
disorders (anxiety, depression, personality change and psychosis) that are caused by physical
illnesses or by drugs and other substances.
Delirium
Delirium is a syndrome caused by a reversible and global derangement of brain metabolism that
includes behavioural, psychological and physical symptoms. Any medical condition or substance
that directly or indirectly affects the central nervous system can cause delirium. Since delirium
can present with any of the abnormalities seen on the mental state examination, it may be
mistaken for a functional mental disorder, an error that can result in serious morbidity or even
death.
There is usually a relatively rapid onset of symptoms and signs in delirium. The critical clinical
feature is an altered level of consciousness that can vary from mild inattention and clouding
through to coma, and may fluctuate over time. Monitor your countertransference and be aware
of feeling irritated if a person cannot give you a clear history or is otherwise uncooperative.
This may be the clue to the diagnosis of delirium. Other signs include poor concentration and
attention; disorientation in time, place and person; hallucinations, especially visual and tactile;
reversal of the sleep-wake cycle; fleeting persecutory ideation; disorganisation of thinking and
behaviour; and either psychomotor agitation or reduced activity and awareness.
A person’s inability to give you a clear history may be a sign of delirium.
The diagnosis of delirium should be suspected in any person with a relatively rapid onset of
disorientation and unusual behaviour. A rapid first onset of psychotic symptoms in a person over
50 is likely to be caused by delirium.
The sudden onset of psychotic symptoms in a person over the age of 50 is
likely to be a sign of delirium.
Important causes to keep in mind include alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal, infection
(e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection and meningitis), drug toxicity (e.g. lithium, benztropine,
carbamazepine, digoxin) subdural haematoma, subarachnoid haemorrhage, congestive cardiac
failure and Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Drugs with anticholinergic side effects are particularly
prone to cause delirium. These include tricyclic antidepressants, traditional antipsychotics
(especially low potency agents such as chlorpromazine and thioridazine) and anti-Parkinsonian
agents. The treatment of delirium involves placing the person in a safe physical environment
(e.g. medical ward, nursing home or under close supervision at home); identifying and treating
the underlying medical disorder; monitoring food and fluid intake; and providing symptomatic
sedation. Suggested drug doses for use in the delirious patient are shown in Table 17-11
. Many
psychiatrists now prescribe risperidone in preference to haloperidol because of the absence of
anticholinergic side effects. Use the least invasive route of administration that is practical—oral
before intramuscular before intravenous. Monitor vital signs after administration of a sedative.

Avoid using benzodiazepines in people with respiratory depression. If the cause of the delirium is
alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, treatment will include administration of a cross-tolerant
benzodiazepine such as diazepam.

Dementia
Dementia is characterised by a decline in cognitive functioning that is severe enough to produce
significant disability and handicap. In contrast to delirium, which involves an acute derangement
of brain function, dementia is associated with progressive neuronal loss.
Dementia always involves some loss of memory (learning new information and recalling
previously learned information). Other cognitive disturbances include:
a) aphasia
b) apraxia
c) agnosia
d) executive function disturbance (planning, organisation, sequencing and abstraction).
Dementia always involves some loss of memory.
Associated features include spatial disorientation, impaired judgement and insight, and
disinhibition. Dementia may be complicated by the development of depression (especially
early in the course when a person retains insight into his or her condition), anxiety, delusions
(especially persecutory), hallucinations (most commonly visual) and delirium. The risk of suicide
is highest early in the course. People with dementia may occasionally be violent. Dementia is
sometimes associated with motor disturbances of gait and slurred speech.
People with early dementia may experience intense anxiety upon having their declining
intellectual function made evident (catastrophic reaction).
Aetiology
The commonest cause is Alzheimer’s Disease (65 per cent of cases). Vascular dementia accounts
for a further 10 per cent. Note, however, that at autopsy as many as 20 per cent have evidence
of both Alzheimer’s Disease and vascular dementia. Around 15 per cent of dementias have some
reversible component (see Table 17-2).
Fifteen per cent of dementias have a reversible component.
Organic mental disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 157
Taking a history
Both the patient and his or her relatives should be interviewed. Early manifestations of dementia
may include changes in behaviour, e.g. excessive orderliness, interpersonal withdrawal, labile
mood, sudden outbursts of anger, apathy, deterioration in grooming, telling silly jokes or
suspiciousness and paranoia. Sufferers may complain of the problems themselves, or they may
deny or try to rationalise them.
Differential diagnosis
•	 Exclude any treatable cause of dementia.
•	 In delirium, there is an altered level of consciousness and a disturbance in attention and
concentration. The onset is usually acute and cognitive impairment often fluctuates throughout
the day.
•	 In the elderly, severe mental illness can present with apparent cognitive deficits (e.g. depressive
pseudodementia).
In contrast to dementia, delirium generally has an acute onset and is
characterised by an altered or fluctuating level of consciousness.
Complications
Some complications of dementia are listed in Table 17-3.
Prognosis
The course depends on the cause. A dementia secondary to neurosyphilis, for example, should
gradually improve with treatment. In Alzheimer’s Disease there tends to be a steady decline.
The course for vascular dementia is sometimes described in textbooks as having a step-wise
deterioration, but is in fact quite variable.

Treatment
Family counselling
The burden of care of people suffering dementia falls largely on the family, especially in the early
stages. Emotional reactions include frustration with the person’s behaviour, grief and sadness over
the loss of the person they knew, anxiety that he or she may come to harm, and conflict among
family members over what is best for the person. Educating the family about the nature of the
illness, its signs and symptoms, its prognosis, and the available supports will help alleviate some
of these reactions and enable the family to make informed decisions about future care. Many of
the interventions discussed below require family involvement or are directed at minimising the
burden of care. Families and other carers should be made aware of local support groups.
It is essential to involve the family in the treatment of a person with dementia.
Medical treatment
1. Treat the underlying cause of a reversible dementia.
2. The treatment of co-morbid conditions:
•	 physical illnesses, e.g. urinary tract infections, decubitus ulcers, cardiac failure (These may
present with delirium.)
•	 depression
•	 psychotic symptoms
•	 drug toxicity.
3. Encourage exercise and good diet. Physiotherapy may be beneficial.
Complications of dementia include delirium (including drug-induced delirium),
physical illness, depression and psychotic symptoms.
4. Psychotropic medication may sometimes be indicated for treating co-morbid illness.
•	 Doses of psychotropics should be kept as low as possible (e.g. haloperidol 0.25–0.5mg/
day, risperidone 0.5–1mg/day, olanzapine 2.5–5mg/day). However, higher doses are
sometimes required. Excessive sedation can exacerbate confusion. Anticholinergic effects
can lead to delirium. Parkinsonian side effects can cause falls.
•	 Long-acting benzodiazepines should be used with caution because of their tendency to
accumulate and affect balance and coordination, leading to falls and fractures.
•	 Many psychotropic drugs have significant anticholinergic effects. Particular care is
required when such medications are combined. Anticholinergic delirium is a serious
complication.
Table 17-3: Complications of dementia
•	 danger to self and others as a result of impaired judgement
•	 depression and suicide, especially early in the course
•	motor disturbances, especially in subcortical dementias, such as Huntington’s Disease, Parkinson’s
Disease and vascular dementias
•	 psychotic symptoms – delusions (especially persecutory) and hallucinations
•	 delirium – increased susceptibility to physical illness and drug-induced delirium
•	 vulnerability to stress, both physical (illness and surgery) and psychosocial (any change in
environment)
Organic mental disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 159
Drugs with anti-cholinergic side effects should be used with caution in people
with dementia because of the risk of causing delirium.
5. Treatment of cognitive impairment
Younger sufferers, who are living at home and suffer mild to moderate symptoms, may
benefit from treatment with an anti-cholinesterase inhibitor. Though these drugs do not
alter the progression of the disease, in clinical trials people treated with anticholinesterase
inhibitors showed less deterioration in cognitive functioning than those on placebo. Two
drugs are presently approved for the treatment of the cognitive impairment of dementia—
donepezil and tacrine. Since donepezil has little effect on butyrylcholinesterase, it is thought
to be selective for CNS sites. Its long half-life permits once daily dosing. Recommended
doses are between 5 and 10 mg per day. Unlike tacrine, it is generally well tolerated and does
not cause hepatic toxicity. Side effects (including nausea, diarrhoea, insomnia, vomiting and
loss of appetite) tend to be mild and often resolve over the first weeks of therapy.
Recommended doses of tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine, THA) are between 10 and 40mg
a day. The short half-life means that it must be administered four times a day. Fortnightly
liver function tests are required over the first four weeks to monitor for elevations in alanine
transaminase. Monitoring is then required monthly for three months, and every three
months for the duration of treatment. Full blood examinations are required every six weeks
for the first six months of treatment, and then every three months. Gastrointestinal side
effects (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) may be troublesome and often lead to cessation of
treatment.
Since there is no evidence for the efficacy of these drugs in severe dementia, they should
be ceased when the illness progresses to this stage1
. Other drugs under investigation include
SB 202026 and milameline (muscarinic partial agonists), non-steroidal antiinflammatories,
oestrogen, nicotine, Vitamin E and selegiline (a Monoamine Oxidase Type B Inhibitor)2
.
Use community supports
These include the Alzheimer’s Association, Dementia Helpline and ARAFMI (Association for
the Relatives and Friends of the Mentally Ill). Contact your local community health service for
assistance with the following:
•	 home help
•	 meals on wheels
•	 community nursing
•	 information about other agencies
•	 respite (including in-home respite, day centres and residential respite for when
the family is on holiday)
•	 assessment by the Aged Care AssessmentTeam
•	 information about support groups for carers.

Organising finances
Testamentary capacity
While the person still retains testamentary capacity, he or she should be encouraged to make out
a will. The assessment of whether a person retains this capacity depends on his or her ability to
understand the nature and purpose of a will, to have a broad understanding of his or her financial
assets, and to be able to name the people who might legitimately have a claim to assets in the
will. He or she must be free of delusions that might directly influence the content of the will and
must be under no undue influence from others on the disbursement of his or her assets.
Enduring power of attorney
The following discussion refers to current Queensland law. You need to be familiar with the
laws in your state/territory. A person must be able to understand the contract granting power
of attorney. It enables him or her (the principal) to grant an enduring power of attorney to a
named individual or individuals (the attorneys). The date or occasion upon which the power of
attorney becomes activated is specified on the form. The power of attorney is enduring because
it continues when the person loses the capacity to make decisions. Under the Queensland
Powers of Attorney Act 1998, an Enduring Power of Attorney can authorise the attorney to
make both financial and health care decisions on behalf of the other person. If you become
aware of problems in the way an attorney is managing a person’s affairs, you should notify the
Adult Guardian (phone 07 32340870 or 1300 653 187). Forms are available from newsagencies,
GoPrint bookshops, Commonwealth Government Bookshops and legal stationers.
The Public Trustee
In Queensland, if a person who has not appointed an enduring power of attorney becomes
incapable of managing his or her financial affairs, the Adult Guardian should be contacted.
The Adult Guardian will then arrange for the Public Trustee to manage the person’s financial
affairs.
Consent for medical procedures
This matter is dealt with by different laws in each state/territory. The Queensland Powers of
Attorney Act of 1998 defines the ways in which health care decisions can be made on behalf of
people whose decision-making capacity is impaired.
Advance health directive
This document allows the individual to give general instructions about his/her future health
care, including end-of-life decisions, such as refusal of life-sustaining medical treatment, if he
or she is terminally ill. In Queensland, this does not include instructions for a doctor to help a
person die.
Enduring power of attorney
As mentioned above, a person (the principal) can appoint another (the attorney) to make future
health care decisions on his or her behalf if at some time in the future the principal loses the
capacity to make such decisions.
Statutory Health Attorney
In the case of a person who develops a decision making disability, but has not appointed an
enduring Power of Attorney, the Queensland Act makes provision for a close relative or carer
who is readily available and could be expected to take responsibility to be able to make health
care decisions on his or her behalf. The Statutory Health Attorney is appointed by the Adult
Guardian. If no suitable person is available, the Adult Guardian can make these decisions. This
replaces the previous informal practice of having the next-of-kin make these decisions.
Work
Repetitive tasks may remain within the capacity of someone with early dementia. Jobs that
carry responsibility for others, include an element of risk and require clear judgment, must be
discontinued.
Organic mental disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 161
Education
Explain the prognosis of the condition to patients, their families and other carers. In deciding
how explicit to be, it is best to be guided by the individual’s questions. Relatives will often want
a clear description of the prognosis so that decisions affecting the long-term interests of the
family can be made. Families may be reassured to know that a person’s distress over his or her
impairment tends to lessen with the progress of the condition.
Relatives of people with dementia need a clear description of the prognosis so
that decisions affecting the long-term interests of the family can be made.
Disability support
This involves decreasing the need for functions lost while maximising the use of residual
functions. Some advice for carers is contained in Table 17-4.
Driving
Medical practitioners have a responsibility to notify the Department of Transport if, as a
consequence of a medical condition, a person may be unfit to drive. Other family members are
often good witnesses as to the person’s driving ability. If you are unsure, refer the person for a
driving test.
Living situation
Plans are best made well in advance if it is anticipated that the person will need to move to a
hostel, retirement village or a nursing home. In Queensland, the local Aged Care Assessment
Team (ACAT) carries out the assessment of suitable placement.
Other mental disorders due to general medical conditions or
substance use
Physical disorders can sometimes lead to psychological symptoms in the absence of dementia
or delirium. A list of conditions that can cause depression is given in Table 17-5. Conditions
that can cause anxiety are listed in Table 17-6. Conditions that can cause psychosis are listed in
Table 21-3. Personality change can result from head trauma, cerebrovascular accident (especially
affecting the frontal lobes), epilepsy, HIV infection, hypo- or hyperthyroidism and systemic lupus
erythematosis. Psychotic symptoms can be caused by physical disorders affecting the central
nervous system, especially subcortical structures or the temporal lobes. These include cerebral
neoplasms, cerebrovascular accidents, Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, auditory nerve injury,
deafness, migraine, central nervous system infections, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, metabolic
imbalance and systemic lupus erythematosis.
Table 17-4: Advice for carers of people with dementia
•	Avoid, where possible, novel or disturbing experiences. Structured activities that take place at regular
times each day will minimise disorientation in time. Maintaining a person in familiar surroundings
will minimise disorientation in place.
•	When frightened by unfamiliar tasks, people with dementia may sometimes be distracted on to
familiar subjects with which they are confident and comfortable.
•	 Set aside extra time for routine tasks, such as eating, dressing and bathing.
•	Arrange furniture to minimise disorientation (e.g. place a clock and calendar in a prominent
position; keep familiar possessions about; use cues (e.g. a sign on the toilet).
•	 Recognise that it will often be necessary to repeat instructions and advice (e.g. to remind the
person where she or he is). Similarly, carers must tolerate being asked the same questions repeatedly
(perseveration).
162
Any disease or substance that affects the central nervous system can cause
mental symptoms, including depression, anxiety, personality change and
psychosis.
Intoxication or withdrawal from a variety of substances can lead to the development of
psychological symptoms. A list of drugs that can cause depression is given in Table 17-7.
Drugs that can cause anxiety are listed in Table 17-8. Alcohol abuse can be complicated by the
development of psychotic symptoms, depression or anxiety during intoxication or withdrawal.
Amphetamines and cocaine can cause psychotic symptoms during intoxication, and depression
and anxiety during both intoxication and withdrawal. The use of marijuana can cause psychotic
symptoms and anxiety during intoxication. Benzodiazepines can cause psychosis and depression
during intoxication and anxiety during withdrawal.

Substance abuse
Substance abuse is a common presentation in general practice. Around 13 per cent of adults abuse
alcohol at some time in their lives with between three and five per cent of men and one per cent
of women becoming alcohol dependent. Alcohol is a contributing factor in around 50 per cent
of motor vehicle fatalities, 50 per cent of homicides and 25 per cent of suicides. Illicit drug use
is most prevalent among young people, especially young men. The assessment of substance abuse
is complicated by the fact that few sufferers will present with the problem directly.
Alcohol is a contributing factor in around 25 per cent of suicides.
Assessment
1. Screening
People with substance abuse often deny their problem. Do not hesitate to ask. A useful
screening test for alcohol abuse is the CAGE questionnaire. Two or more positive answers
are correlated with alcohol dependence in over 90 per cent of cases.
C – Have you ever thought you should CUT DOWN on your drinking?
A – Have you ever felt ANNOYED by others’ criticism of your drinking?
G – Have you ever felt GUILTY about your drinking?
E – Do you have a morning EYE OPENER?
Take particular care in assessing people who do not fit the stereotype of a substance abuser,
e.g. a woman with panic disorder and agoraphobia. Substance abuse is common in this
group. People may be secretive about their substance abuse.
The CAGE questionnaire is a useful screening instrument for detecting alcohol
abuse.
2. Reason for presentation
People commonly present with unrelated problems, or with physical or psychological
complications of the substance abuse. They may be motivated to do something about their
problems because of the threat of job loss, marital breakdown or legal difficulties.
3. Extent and pattern of abuse
Document the amount of the substance consumed, the time course of the problem and the
pattern of abuse. For example, the amount of alcohol consumed should be quantified in
terms of the number of standard drinks per day. A standard drink is equivalent to a 200ml
glass of beer, a 90ml glass of wine or a 30ml glass of spirits. A small bottle of beer is equivalent
to 1½ standard drinks, a large bottle to 3½. A bottle of wine is equivalent to eight standard
drinks. Recommended safe maximum daily quantities are four standard drinks for men
and two for women. Patterns of drinking vary between different populations. For example,
Anglo-Saxons typically binge drink, while those from continental Europe more often drink
steadily. Ask if the person has suffered any symptoms of withdrawal and whether he or she
requires larger amounts to get the same effect (tolerance). Try to uncover the precipitants
of the substance abuse. Drinking binges typically occur at times of stress. Identifying the
emotional state that leads people to abuse substances is often complicated by their inability
to identify and describe feelings (alexithymia). The alexithymic person is prone to act out in
Chapter 18
166
order to modulate unpleasant affects, rather than to recognise and articulate how he or she
feels.
4. Disability and handicap
Ask about the social consequences of the substance abuse—loss of employment, legal
problems (e.g. driving under the influence, charges for possession of illicit substances), marital
and family problems and financial problems. Assess the amount of time spent obtaining,
taking or recovering from the substances abused (salience), and about activities that have
been given up or reduced as a consequence of the abuse.
5. Past treatments
Document previous treatments that were most effective for that individual.
6. Co-morbidity
The physical and mental health problems associated with the abuse of specific substances are
discussed below.
7. Mental state examination
Assess for the substance-specific effects of intoxication and withdrawal and, where applicable,
complications of abuse—delirium, dementia, psychosis, anxiety or depression.
8. Physical examination and investigations
Assess the substance-specific physical complications discussed below.
Diagnosis
The DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence include a pattern of substance use that results
in significant impairment, disability and handicap, and includes at least three of the following:
tolerance (i.e. increased amounts of the substance required to achieve the same effect, or less
effect with the same amount); withdrawal, or taking substances to avoid withdrawal symptoms;
larger amounts taken than intended; repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down; a lot of time
spent obtaining, using or recovering from the effects of the substance; abandoning important
social, occupational, or recreational activities because of the substance abuse; or continued use
of the substance despite knowledge of having a persistent physical or psychological illness that
is caused or exacerbated by it1
. The DSM-IV also includes the category, ‘substance abuse’, for
those cases in which problems exist, but the criteria for dependence are not met. This diagnosis
requires the continued use of substances in situations that are hazardous (e.g. drink-driving) or
that result in significant physical or mental health problems, disability or handicap.
The abuse of substances is associated with specific syndromes of intoxication and withdrawal.
Some may cause psychological symptoms—delusions, hallucinations, depression or anxiety.
Complications include delirium and dementia. Hallucinogens can cause flashbacks.
Formulation
The formulation will help you tailor treatment to the individual patient.
Biological factors
Family studies have demonstrated a strong genetic contribution to the development of alcohol
abuse. Monozygotic twins have around twice the concordance rate as do dizygotic twins. The
offspring of alcoholics have around four times the chance of developing alcoholism as do the
children of non-alcoholics, even when raised apart form their families of origin. This biological
predisposition provides some evidence for the formulation of alcoholism as a disease, a central
tenet of the beliefs underlying Alcoholics Anonymous. However, the incomplete concordance
in monozygotic twins is evidence that environmental factors also play a part.

Substance abuse
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 167
Psychological factors
People may use substances for their pleasurable effects or to avoid some emotional pain. In
some cases, people use substances to cope with the psychological symptoms of depression and
anxiety. Unfortunately, the use of substances, while alleviating symptoms during intoxication,
may worsen them in the long-term.
People may abuse substances in an attempt to treat their mental disorders.
These often exacerbate the symptoms.
Mental disorders associated with substance abuse include anxiety, depression and antisocial
personality disorder. The rate of suicide among alcoholics has been estimated to be between 60
and 120 times the rate among non-alcoholics. Alcohol use is a contributing factor in as many as
25 per cent of completed suicides. Co-morbidity rates among the abusers of illicit drugs have
been calculated to be 53 per cent, a rate higher than that for alcoholics (37 per cent).
Mental disorders that are commonly associated with substance abuse include
anxiety, depression and antisocial personality disorder.
The psychodynamics of substance abuse suggest that people may abuse drugs to deal with
problems in self-esteem and to assist in the modulation of unpleasant affects (anxiety, depression,
shame, guilt and rage). These disorders reflect problems in impulse control that may be manifest
in other aspects of the person’s behaviour such as criminality, self-harm and violence. Substance
abuse can be a form of ‘acting out’. People may use substances to suppress or remove unpleasant
affective states instead of identifying and articulating how they feel, and taking steps to deal with
the problems that give rise to these feelings. People sometimes use substances in response to
problems in their interpersonal relationships.
Social factors
Substance abuse may occur in response to social stressors. The abuse of illicit drugs is often
complicated by criminal behaviour required to obtain the substances. The prevalence of abuse
increases with ready access to the drug. Peer pressure in often a factor, especially in young
people experimenting with drugs. The use of some substances is glamorised in the media and
in advertising.
Certain professions are at high risk. For example, bartenders, journalists, musicians, writers and
doctors have higher rates of alcohol abuse than others. Young, single, unemployed youth from
socially deprived backgrounds are at relatively high risk of opiate abuse.
Treatment
The principles of treatment include the following:
1. Therapeutic alliance
Be aware of countertransference responses of anger and helplessness. Substance abusers have
often been met by hostility and rejection in the past. Convey your concern about the
problem, but be careful neither to judge nor try to take responsibility for it. It is often useful
to acknowledge that you are powerless to stop a person abusing substances. You cannot stop
a young man who abuses illicit drugs from obtaining the substances, nor can you stop an
alcoholic from going to the pub. Within a strong therapeutic alliance, you will be able to
confront people about their substance abuse without alienating them.
2. Care in prescribing
General practitioners often face demands to prescribe or administer therapeutic drugs. For
locum doctors attending people in their homes, this can also be dangerous. Have a high
index of suspicion of people who ask for opiates or benzodiazepines, especially those who
168
have not consulted you before. If in doubt, you may prescribe small quantities of the drug.
Suspected addicts should be reported to state health authorities. In the absence of legitimate
indications, you should calmly, but firmly, refuse to prescribe the drug.
3. Education
Educate the person and his or her family about the effects of intoxication and withdrawal,
and the physical and mental disorders that may complicate abuse of the substance. Outline
the treatment options available, including the relevant drug and alcohol dependency agencies,
non-government organisations and self-help groups.
4. Diagnosis and treatment of co-morbid physical and mental disorders
The assessment of whether psychological symptoms are caused by the substance abuse or are
evidence of a co-morbid condition is often difficult. Consider the symptoms of intoxication
and withdrawal for the specific substance involved. Generally, withdrawal symptoms will
resolve after two to four weeks. Persistence of symptoms beyond this period suggests the
presence of a separate condition.
5. Treatment of the psychosocial complications of abuse
Issues that all substance abusers have to face are the losses associated with their habit.
These include losses of physical health, work opportunities, family, friends and finances.
Unfortunately, identifying the stressors that precipitate abuse is often difficult because of
the tendency for substance abusers to deny both their abuse and their other problems. The
principles of counselling and structured problem solving described in Chapter 6 can be used
to help deal with these losses and with other stressors.
6. Self-help groups
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help organisation that was set up in the USA after the
lifting of prohibition in 1937. It is based on the belief that alcoholism in a disease over which
the sufferer has no control. Members are taught that they need to submit to a higher power
in order to maintain abstinence. In the meetings, sufferers give testimonies of their problems
and provide mutual support. Although very effective for some, AA tends to have less appeal
for young people, women and members of minority groups. Others have difficulty accepting
the ideology of the organisation. Ancillary groups exist for the families of sufferers (Al-ATeen and Al Anon). Similar groups exist for those who abuse other substances (e.g. Narcotics
Anonymous). However, these have generally been less successful, in part because of the
different age group and subculture affected.
7. Family work
Substance abuse invariably affects the spouses, families and others close to the person. The loss
of social supports is an important perpetuating factor in the illness. The reactions of family
members may inadvertently reinforce the substance abuse. Family members may themselves
suffer psychological problems as a result of a person’s substance abuse. Both the patient and
family members must acknowledge that abstinence is ultimately the responsibility of the
patient. No matter how concerned someone else might be, he or she cannot stop another
adult from obtaining and abusing drugs (see Box 18-1).
Both the patient and family members must acknowledge that abstinence is
ultimately the responsibility of the patient.
Box 18-1: Abstinence is the patient’s responsibility
A 55-year-old man who suffers alcohol dependence presents with his wife. He complains that she
has not been vigilant enough recently in monitoring his drinking. Last week he went on a three-day
drinking binge and she did nothing about it. The man is projecting responsibility for his problem on
to his wife. She is made to feel how powerless he feels in trying to overcome his problem. In such a
case, you would be concerned about her welfare, including her safety.
Substance abuse
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 169
8. Abstinence or controlled use
Whether the goal is abstinence or controlled use will depend on the substance used and
the individual concerned. Abstinence is recommended during pregnancy, in cases of
polysubstance abuse, when there are serious physical or mental complications of the abuse,
when previous attempts at controlled use have failed, or when there is significant disability
and handicap.
Abstinence, as opposed to controlled use, is advised in the following:
during pregnancy, in cases of poly-substance abuse, when there are serious
complications of abuse, when previous attempts at controlled use have failed,
and when there is significant disability and handicap.
Complications of the abuse of specific substances
In this section, I discuss the assessment and treatment of the complications of the abuse of some
common substances.
Alcohol
Forty per cent of those who abuse alcohol have a good outcome, 47 per cent continue to
abuse and the remainder have a fair to poor outcome. Unfortunately, the impact of treatment is
sometimes modest with 19 per cent improving spontaneously over a 12-month period and 26
per cent improving with treatment1
. Predictors of a good outcome include finding a substitute
for the dependency (e.g. devotion to work, a consuming interest or hobby, or membership of
a cohesive religious or therapeutic group such as AA); a serious threat to one’s physical health,
marital and family relationships or career; legal problems; or a new relationship.
Consider the following in the treatment of a person with alcohol withdrawal:
1. Place the person in a well-lit room. Monitoring vital signs and mental status will guide the
doses of diazepam administered and the supportive measures required to maintain fluid
and electrolyte balance. Investigations may include electrolytes and liver function tests, full
blood examination and clotting studies. A chest X-ray may be indicated if there are signs of
infection. A CT scan of the head may be needed if there is any evidence of head trauma.
2. Administration of diazepam until calm with a tapering dose over the next seven to 14
days; Thiamine 100mg intramuscularly daily for three to five days, then 100mg orally, daily
with vitamin B complex. These are continued over the following months to prevent the
development of Wernicke’s encephalopathy (see following).
During alcohol withdrawal, thiamine and vitamin B complex are given to
prevent the development of Wernicke’s encephalopathy.
3. Supportive measures to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, to guard against aspiration,
and to avoid hypoglycaemia.
4. The treatment of co-morbid conditions, including possible closed head injury, Wernicke’s
encephalopathy, infections, acute liver and cardiac problems, and seizures.
The physical complications of alcohol abuse include gastritis, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, liver
disease, diarrhoea, hypertension, trauma, impotence, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar
degeneration and cardiomyopathy. Alcohol abuse is also associated with a number of mental
1 Parloff MB, London P, Wolfe B. Individual psychotherapy and behavior change. Annual Review of
Psychology 1986; 37: 321-349.
170
disorders. A failure to diagnose and treat these disorders will prevent adequate treatment of the
substance abuse:
1. anxiety disorders – These are the commonest mental disorders found in association with
alcohol abuse. The symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include anxiety and panic attacks.
People with phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder may self-medicate with alcohol.
2. depression – Alcohol can cause or exacerbate depression. In some cases, a person may drink
in order to alleviate symptoms of depression.
3. suicide – The suicide rate among alcoholics is between 50 and 120 times that for the rest of
the population. Alcohol is a contributing factor in around 25 per cent of suicides.
4. psychosis – Alcohol may interact with antipsychotic medications and lead to behavioural
problems in those with psychotic illnesses. Alcohol hallucinosis usually arises during
withdrawal and is characterised by auditory hallucinations that persist after the physical
withdrawal. People with alcohol hallucinosis should be carefully assessed for suicidality and
dangerousness.
5. neuropsychiatric disorders – Wernicke’s encephalopathy is a medical emergency. It is an acute
brain syndrome that is characterised by delirium, confusion, ataxia, bilateral symmetrical
ophthalmoplegia especially affecting the sixth cranial nerve, and nystagmus. It is caused by
thiamine deficiency that is often associated with alcohol abuse. Treatment includes thiamine
100mg intramuscularly and oral vitamin B complex over the following months.
If left untreated, this condition may progress to Korsakoff’s Psychosis. The syndrome includes
short-term memory deficits, confabulation, polyneuropathy and disturbed eye movements
(including lateral nystagmus and paralysis of conjugate gaze). Alcohol abuse can also be
associated with the development of dementia.
6. foetal alcohol syndrome – The child may suffer mental retardation and various anatomical
abnormalities (cleft palate, microcephaly and hypospadias).
Alcohol abuse is associated with anxiety disorders, depression, suicide,
psychosis, neuropsychiatric conditions (including Wernicke’s encephalopathy,
Korsakoff’s Psychosis, dementia and foetal alcohol syndrome).
Disulfiram is sometimes used as an aversive measure in the treatment of chronic alcoholism. It
should be prescribed to physically fit, highly motivated people with a good record of adherence
to treatment who are involved in a structured therapeutic program that includes regular checks
on adherence. In view of the serious interactions with alcohol, I recommend referral to a
specialist unit if this treatment seems indicated.
Opiates
Psychological symptoms of opiate intoxication include euphoria, drowsiness and sometimes,
anxiety. Physical signs include pupillary constriction, slurred speech, respiratory depression,
hypotension, nausea, vomiting and constipation. Opiate overdose can cause death through
respiratory depression and pulmonary oedema. Treatment involves monitoring, support and the
administration of intravenous naloxone.
The treatment of opiate intoxication includes monitoring, general supportive
measures and the administration of naloxone.
Opiate withdrawal is usually managed in a specialised inpatient facility. Symptoms of withdrawal
include nausea, abdominal cramps, muscle aches, sweating, gooseflesh, restlessness, lacrimation,
nasal congestion and tachycardia. Physical complications of chronic opiate use include overdose,
Substance abuse

malnutrition, HIV infection, hepatitis and other infections. Associated psychological problems
include depression, anxiety and antisocial personality disorder. Efforts to obtain the drugs may
lead to criminality and prostitution.
Criteria for methadone maintenance include prolonged physiological dependence on opiates,
pregnancy, or failed attempts at drug detoxification. The aim is to reduce the craving for heroin
use, prevent the complications of intravenous drug use and permit rehabilitation. It can also limit
criminal behaviour associated with drug seeking. Longer-term residential programs provide
drug-free environments in which rehabilitation can occur.
Criteria for methadone maintenance include prolonged physiological
dependence on opiates, pregnancy, or failed attempts at detoxification.
Cannabis
Cannabis is used as either leaves (marijuana) or resin (hashish) that are either smoked or eaten.
The principal active agent is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Complications of intoxication
with cannabis include anxiety, derealisation and acute paranoid states. It may hasten relapse in
people with psychotic disorders. There is no conclusive evidence that it causes psychosis, but
there is anecdotal evidence that the use of cannabis can precipitate a first episode and worsen
the prognosis.
Stimulants
Amphetamines may be taken orally, intravenously or by nasal ingestion. Cocaine is usually
taken nasally or smoked. Intoxication can be complicated by seizures, myocardial infarction,
cerebrovascular accident, damage to the foetus and nasal ulceration. Adverse psychological
reactions include manic-like symptoms, anxiety, paranoia, aggression and poor judgement.
Treatment of intoxication may require antipsychotic medication, support and protection.
Withdrawal symptoms include depression, suicidality, fatigue, insomnia and irritability.
Hallucinogens
The common hallucinogens include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psylocibin (in ‘magic
mushrooms’) and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ‘ecstasy’). Adverse
reactions include anxiety, depersonalisation, derealisation, depression, illusions, hallucinations,
delusions, risk-taking behaviour and flashbacks. Treatment involves sedation with diazepam
and sometimes haloperidol. Chlorpromazine can sometimes cause a paradoxical reaction with
increased anxiety.
Solvents
Common inhaled agents include petrol, glues, lighter fluids and nitrous oxide. The abuse of these
substances is most prevalent among young people, especially those in low socioeconomic groups.
Adverse effects include confusion, disorientation, impulsive behaviour, ataxia, psychosis, seizures
and coma. Death can result from respiratory depression, asphyxiation and cardiac arrest. Longterm use of solvents can cause damage to the cerebellum, liver, kidneys and bone marrow.
Hypnotics
The commonest hypnotics abused these days are benzodiazepines, although barbiturate abuse is
still occasionally seen. Among the benzodiazepines, the commonest abused drugs are the more
potent ones such as flunitrazepam and alprazolam. The effects of intoxication and withdrawal
are similar to those for alcohol. Symptoms and signs of intoxication include drowsiness,
confusion, disinhibition, slurred speech, ataxia, poor coordination and nystagmus. Fatalities can
occur from respiratory depression or inhalation of gastric contents. Symptoms of withdrawal
172
include anxiety, tremor, sweating, irritability and insomnia. Delirium can occur with visual
hallucinations and formication. Seizures and coma may complicate withdrawal. Prevention is
the cornerstone of treatment. Educate patients about the dangers of tolerance, dependence and
withdrawal. In particular, advise them of the danger of withdrawal seizures. Prescribe only small
quantities over short periods of time. Treatment of withdrawal involves close monitoring of
mental state and vital signs while a long-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam is administered
in gradually diminishing doses. For the older person who has been dependent on a small dose
of a benzodiazepine or barbiturate for many years, it is sometimes best to continue the drug at
the current dose.
Substance abuse
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 173
Somatoform disorders
People often present to general practitioners with physical symptoms for which no organic cause
can be found, or which are in excess of what would be expected from a physical disorder that
is present. The prevalence among general practice attendees has been estimated to be between
25 and 50 per cent. The presentations fall into three groups: unexplained physical symptoms,
hypochondriasis, and mental disorders presenting with somatic symptoms. In one study, the
prevalence of these conditions among general practice attendees was found to be 16.6 per cent,
7.7 per cent and 8 per cent1 respectively.
Between 20 and 50 per cent of general practice attendees present with
physical symptoms for which no organic cause can be found.
A failure to diagnose and treat these conditions will have a number of adverse consequences.
The person will continue to suffer symptoms, disability and handicap. Treatable mental disorders
will be missed. Unnecessary investigations and unwarranted treatments are costly and can lead
to further disability. Excessive specialist referrals are expensive and will reinforce the person’s
conviction that there is something physically treatable that continues to elude diagnosis. The
dissatisfied patient is likely to seek help from other doctors. I begin this chapter with a discussion
of the assessment of the somatoform disorders in general. I then discuss the treatment of
unexplained physical symptoms and hypochondriasis. Although the prolonged fatigue syndromes
fall within the category of unexplained physical symptoms, I include a separate discussion of
their treatment because of their high prevalence in general practice settings.
Assessment
People with somatoform disorders are difficult to assess. They are often frustrated with their
previous medical advice and unwilling to consider psychological contributions to their suffering.
Consider the following steps in the assessment:
Review the medical record
These people have often had several consultations with a number of different practitioners. Their
records are likely to contain several specialist reports and the results of many investigations. Note
the responses to previous treatments and any indications of the attitudes of the person towards
the illness, including his or her attitude to the possible contribution of psychological factors.
Interview with spouse or other family member
It is useful to seek collateral information about the nature and time course of symptoms, and the
levels of disability and handicap. Ask about current psychosocial stressors and any relationship to
the onset of the symptoms. Try to engage the family in treatment and rehabilitation.
Interview techniques
The approach you take in the interview and in subsequent treatment will depend on the ability
of the person to accept the contribution of psychological factors to the problem. Some people
Chapter 19
1 Kirmayer LJ, Robbins JM. Three forms of somatization in primary care: prevalence, co-occurrence,
and sociodemographic characteristics. The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 1991; 179: 647-655.
174
will readily do so and engage in psychological treatments. Others will, to varying degrees, resist
such an explanation, insisting that you must find and treat a physical cause.
Some people readily accept the contribution of psychological factors to their
problems. Others resist such an explanation and insist that you find a physical
cause.
Goldberg and others have proposed a three-stage model for helping people with unexplained
physical symptoms to re-attribute their symptoms and relate them to psychosocial problems1
.
The first step involves making the person feel understood. Give the person time to describe his
or her complaints. Take a full history of the symptoms, their time course and any precipitants.
Ask about the symptom’s occurrence over a typical day. Respond to verbal and nonverbal cues
by making empathic comments (‘The pain sounds very severe’, or ‘You must get fed up when
doctors cannot get rid of the pain’), clarifying (‘Tell me when the pain first began’) and asking
about the mood (‘How did that make you feel?’). Establish a picture of the family and social
context in which the symptoms have arisen. Ask what the person believes the symptoms mean.
Perform a brief physical examination.
The second stage involves changing the agenda to incorporate complaints other than the physical
symptoms. Summarise the physical findings. Acknowledge the reality of the symptoms and the
distress that they cause. Reframe the problems incorporating other symptoms and relating their
onset to stressors in the person’s life. It may be useful to ask the patient to record the situations
in which symptoms were worse during the week, what they were doing at the time, where and
with whom they were.
The final stage involves making an explicit link between the person’s emotional state and the
physical symptoms. When the symptoms are related to anxiety, explain the pathophysiological
process responsible for causing the symptoms, for example, ‘When people get very anxious, they
often over-breathe. This causes a number of changes in the ability of blood to carry oxygen
to the brain that can make you feel dizzy, sweaty and cause tingling in your hands and around
your mouth’. A similar approach is used for depression—‘When people are depressed their pain
threshold is altered so they tend to be more sensitive to pain’. Discuss the other symptoms that the
person suffers that are typical of the underlying mental disorder. It may be useful to demonstrate
how muscular tension can cause muscle aches and pains by, for example, asking the person to
hold a book with his or her arms outstretched. Link the onset and exacerbation of symptoms
to stressful events in the person’s life. It may be useful to ask the patient to record the situations
in which symptoms were worse during the week, what they were doing at the time, and where
and with whom they were. Ask how the person is feeling presently, in the consultation, and
relate this to his or her worries about what the symptoms mean. Ask if any other family member
has suffered similar symptoms and discuss possible psychological contributions to this— it is
often easier for the person to see the links between physical symptoms and stressful events or
psychological problems in someone else. Having completed the assessment, you should now be
in a position to negotiate treatment.
A three-stage model for helping patients reattribute their somatic symptoms
to psychological as well as physical causes includes making the person feel
understood, changing the agenda to incorporate complaints other than physical
symptoms, and making explicit links between his or her emotional state and
the physical symptoms.

Somatoform disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 175
Mental state examination
There are certain features on the mental state examination that are specific to somatoform
disorders. The person may repeatedly return to complain of their symptoms. The symptoms will
sometimes worsen when discussing emotionally painful subjects. The person may have difficulty
explaining the nature of the symptoms and have few words to describe emotional reactions. The
predominant affect may be anger. In others, there is a lack of affective response. It is useful to
note the person’s attitude to the symptoms and the strength of his or her conviction that there
is some physical cause.
Unexplained physical symptoms
People often experience psychological distress with physical symptoms. These are often associated
with a mental disorder, most commonly depression or anxiety. While physical symptoms can
occur in the absence or any physical pathology, more commonly there is some physical disorder
present, but the symptoms are in excess of what would be expected.
In most cases of unexplained physical symptoms, there is some underlying
physical disorder, but the symptoms are in excess of what would be expected.
Presentation
These disorders are characterised by the presence of one or more physical symptoms for
which there is either no medical explanation or the amount of impairment, disability and
handicap is greater than what would be expected from the physical pathology that is present.
Common symptoms include pain (e.g. headaches, abdominal pain), gastrointestinal symptoms
(e.g. constipation and diarrhoea), sexual symptoms (e.g. erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction,
irregular periods or excessive menstrual bleeding), pseudo-neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness,
incoordination, poor balance, localised weakness, urinary retention, sensory changes, seizures or
amnesia) or fatigue. People with unexplained pain tend to make frequent medical consultations,
often to different doctors, and fail to be reassured about the nature of their symptoms.
Diagnosis
Specific disorders include somatisation disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder and the
prolonged fatigue syndromes. Somatisation is a chronic disorder that requires the presence of at
least eight symptoms (four of pain, two gastrointestinal, one sexual and one pseudoneurological),
beginning before the age of 30 years1
. While the prevalence of this disorder is low (between
0.2 per cent and 2 per cent), the presentation of a part-syndrome is very common—between
9 and 20 per cent in community samples). The essential feature of conversion disorder is the
presence of symptoms or deficits affecting voluntary motor or sensory function that cannot
be fully explained by a general medical condition or the effects of a substance. Psychological
factors are seen to play a part in the onset or exacerbation of the symptoms. In pain disorder, the
predominant complaint is of pain, in which psychological factors are judged to have an important
role in the onset, severity, exacerbation or maintenance. The prolonged fatigue syndromes are
discussed below.
The syndromes of unexplained physical symptoms include somatisation
disorder, conversion disorder, chronic pain and the prolonged fatigue
syndromes.

176
Differential diagnosis
Unexplained physical symptoms often arise in the context of other mental disorders. People
with depression may suffer fatigue, loss of energy, restlessness, poor appetite and weight loss (see
Chapter 14). Anxiety is accompanied by a wide variety of physical symptoms, including muscle
tension, fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain, nausea, abdominal distress, dizziness,
paraesthesia, derealisation and depersonalisation (see Chapter 15). The perception of physical
symptoms is altered in several mental disorders: the anxious or depressed person is likely to focus
on the pain, which in turn makes it worse. People suffering from schizophrenia may describe
bizarre physical complaints (see Chapter 22).
Formulation
Biological factors
Unexplained physical symptoms may arise in the absence of any clear physical pathology.
However, more often there is an underlying physical problem, but the symptoms are more
distressing and produce greater disability than would be expected. Chronic conditions can be
complicated by the effects of inactivity, self-medication with alcohol and other substances, and
the iatrogenic complications of prescribed medications, multiple investigations and procedures.
The perception of pain depends not only on the extent and site of physical injury, but also on
the modulation of neural information by gating mechanisms in the dorsal horns of the spinal
cord. Inputs from higher cortical and subcortical areas are integrated with inputs from peripheral
afferent fibres to modulate the perception of pain. This may explain the impact of emotional states
on pain perception and the efficacy of relaxation techniques, cognitive behavioural approaches,
distraction and hypnosis in treatment.
Psychosocial factors
The symptoms can often be understood in terms of the person’s past history. For example, a man
may identify with a parent who, during his childhood, suffered chronic illness. A woman who
was emotionally neglected in childhood may have learnt that the only way she could obtain
support and nurturance was through being sick. The person who was traumatised as a child may
have an unconscious need to continue suffering and to be punished.
The person’s current social milieu may reinforce his or her abnormal illness behaviour. By
adopting the sick role, a person is exempted from his or her normal duties and responsibilities
and may gain attention and support from family members. In doing so, they reinforce the
behaviour. At the same time, the person may covertly express his or her anger with other family
members. Compensation and other legal issues may also play a part in reinforcing the abnormal
illness behaviour. In some cases, the problem may lie with someone else in the person’s social
system (see Box 19-1).
The person’s social milieu may reinforce his or her abnormal illness behaviour.
Box 19-1: When the problem is not with the person who presents
An 87-year-old woman who suffers from early dementia is brought to you repeatedly by her 90-yearold husband because of abdominal pain. She has been admitted to the local hospital on several
occasions, but no physical cause for her symptoms can be found. Her husband is upset that the hospital
will not admit her on this occasion, and he asks you to arrange the admission. An exclusive focus on
the woman’s presenting symptoms may lead you to miss the primary problem—her husband’s inability
to cope. Treatment will include forming a therapeutic alliance with both the woman and her husband
and maximising his social supports to alleviate the burden of care.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 177
Treatment
It is useful to consider two groups of patients—those who present occasionally with physical
symptoms, usually when under stress, and those with chronic unexplained physical symptoms.
Members of the first group are often quite willing to acknowledge a psychological cause for their
symptoms. They will be reassured by an explanation of how stress can produce the presenting
symptoms. Having clarified the stressors facing the individual, structured problem solving can
be used to help the person deal with them (see Chapter 6).
Counselling and structured problem solving will assist people to deal effectively
with stressful events in their lives.
People with chronic unexplained physical symptoms are amongst general practitioners’ most
challenging patients. Consider the following principles of treatment1
:
1. Medical examination is required to uncover any physical cause for the symptoms. The
results of the examination and any investigations should be carefully explained to the
person. The ways in which emotional states can modulate the perception of pain should
also be explained. On repeat visits, new symptoms should be noted and a focused physical
examination performed.
2. Avoid excessive investigations and procedures. Make regular, time-limited appointments.
Dissuade the person from consulting different doctors for the same problems. Only refer to
a specialist if there is clear evidence of serious physical disorder.
Avoid excessive investigations, procedures and specialist referrals when treating
people with unexplained physical symptoms.
3. Diagnose and treat any primary or co-morbid mental disorders, especially depression, anxiety
and substance abuse.
People with unexplained physical symptoms are at risk of developing
depression, anxiety disorders and substance abuse.
4. Acknowledge the pain and explain to the patient that he or she may have to learn to live with
some symptoms. Make the aim of treatment to improve the person’s ability to cope with the
pain, and to have a fulfilling and enjoyable life in spite of it. Concentrate on rehabilitation
rather than cure. Rehabilitation activities include a graduated exercise program and setting
daily activity schedules that include pleasurable activities (see the non-specific treatments
for depression in Chapter 14 and Appendix 7). Teach relaxation techniques (see progressive
muscular relaxation in Appendix 5 and self-hypnosis in Appendix 6).
Concentrate on rehabilitation rather than cure.
5. Try to uncover the psychosocial precipitants to exacerbations of the symptoms and use the
counselling and structured problem solving techniques described in Chapter 6 to help the
person cope with these (see Box 19-2).
6. Involve the family in treatment. Explain the nature of the problem. Try to reach an agreement
with the family and the patient that they should avoid reinforcing the illness behaviour.
1 Bass C, Benjamin S. The management of chronic somatisation. British Journal of Psychiatry 1993; 162:
472-480.
178
Advise family members to acknowledge the person’s symptoms, but to avoid constantly
responding to them. Instead, they should give as much reinforcement and praise as possible
in response to healthy coping and rehabilitation activities.
Encourage family members to avoid responding to pain behaviour but to
reinforce coping behaviours.
7. Monitor your countertransference. People with unexplained physical symptoms present
particular challenges for general practitioners. They will challenge your knowledge and make
you feel anxious that you are missing something. You may feel exasperated by the patient’s
symptoms and his or her failure to get better. Having a clear formulation will organise your
thinking and allay your anxiety. Continuing to deepen your understanding of the problems
will maintain your interest and increase your confidence in the formulation.
8. Consider referral to a psychiatrist. Be straightforward about who you are asking the person
to see.
The formulation and treatment of a man with pain disorder is discussed in Box 19-3.
Box 19-2: Uncovering psychosocial precipitants
A 50-year-old man presents repeatedly to his general practitioner and to the local hospital complaining
of dizziness and loin pain. Thorough examination and appropriate investigation fail to reveal any
physical cause.
 A brief social history reveals serious marital and family problems. He separated from his wife and
three adult children five years before, but he continues to pay his wife’s rent as well as maintenance
for the children. However, relations between the couple remain acrimonious. The precipitant to a
recent hospital admission was an altercation with his oldest son that took place after he refused to let
the young man borrow his car. In response, his son shouted abuse at him and broke a pane of glass
slamming the door as he left.
Comment: The general practitioner focuses on the marital and family problems and attempts to help
the man find better solutions to them through counselling and structured problem solving.
Somatoform disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 179
Prolonged fatigue syndromes
Around 30 per cent of general practice attendees complain of fatigue1, 2, 3, 4, 5
. Prolonged fatigue
presents in several syndrome—chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome. All
are characterised by fatigue, pain, poor concentration and irritability. In chronic fatigue there is
also unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue that lasts longer than six months, that is typically
worse after activity, and is associated with disturbed sleep, myalgia, and tender lymph nodes.
People suffering from fibromyalgia complain of back, joint, muscle and extremity pain. Those
with irritable bowel syndrome complain of diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, bloating
and nausea. For a diagnosis to be made, there must be a significant level of disability, e.g. a 50 per
cent reduction in activity levels over the previous six months.
Around 30 per cent of general practice attendees complain of fatigue.
In many cases, prolonged fatigue occurs in association with a psychological disorder, most
commonly, depression and anxiety. However, in about a third of cases (i.e. around 10 per cent of
general practice attendees) there is no significant psychological disorder present.
Box 19-3: Formulation and treatment of a man with pain disorder
A 37-year-old man consults you regularly for back pain that he has suffered since an injury at work 12
years ago. The pain has been worse since an operation four years ago. Opiate analgesics provide some
relief, but he suffers side effects including constipation. He self-medicates with alcohol (average 10
standard drinks a day). He continues to seek compensation for the injury. His wife is exhausted by her
attempts to continue to support him. At age seven, he was involved in a car accident in which both
of his parents were killed. He is still haunted by images of the car bursting into flames just after he
had managed to crawl to safety. He was subsequently brought up in a foster home where he suffered
physical abuse. He was often unable to attend school because of illness.
Comment: The symptoms can be understood as an unconscious need for punishment in a man who
suffers survivor guilt as part of post-traumatic stress disorder. The abuse by his foster father only
confirmed his sense of himself as a bad person. The pattern for his illness behaviour was already evident
in his youth. The illness is perpetuated by his wife’s continued response to his illness behaviour and also
by the unresolved issue of compensation. He is at risk of driving his wife away with his demands. His
substance abuse will cause secondary impairments and disabilities.
Management of his chronic pain involves treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder with an SSRI
or imipramine, education and rehabilitation. His wife is encouraged to take less responsibility for his
problems, to try to ignore his illness behaviour, but to respond positively to any progress with his
rehabilitation. He is warned about the adverse effects of his alcohol consumption, and referred to the
local Alcohol Tobacco and Other Drugs clinic at the local community health service. Rehabilitation
will involve a graduated exercise program to increase the flexibility and strength of his back and to
improve his general fitness. He is also asked to make a schedule of daily activities that includes at least
one pleasurable activity every day.

Fatigue usually occurs in association with a psychological disorder (especially
depression or anxiety), but in about a third of cases, there is no significant
psychological disorder present.
There is unlikely to be a single cause of prolonged fatigue. Possibilities include chronic viral
infection, immune dysfunction, neuro-endocrine disturbance and underlying depression or
anxiety. What is certain is that disability and handicap may be severe. In particular, a vicious
cycle is often established in which fatigue leads to avoidance of exercise and activity, which in
turn leads to depression, anxiety and a worsening of the physical symptoms.
Assessment
In assessing the person with fatigue, consider possible physical and psychiatric causes (see Table
19-1). Clarify the pattern of the fatigue, whether the person is tired all of the time or only
in certain situations—for example, when at work. Does performing everyday tasks easily tire
the person? Inquire about a man’s lifestyle. Does he get enough sleep; does he do any regular
exercise; is he over-worked; is he bored; are there any current stressors; is he angry about
something? Clarify the onset of the problem. Has it been a problem for a long time; were
there any precipitants? Explore his or her beliefs about the cause of the illness and try later to
incorporate this in a broad, multifactorial formulation of the problem. Assess the person’s level
of disability and handicap—his or her self-care, family and other personal relationships, work
and leisure activities.
Investigations
Investigations that may be useful include:
•	 urinalysis
•	 full blood count and differential
•	 ESR
•	 electrolytes and liver function tests
•	 blood glucose
•	 thyroid function tests
•	 sleep studies
Treatment
Since much of the disability flows from the avoidance of activity and exercise, an essential
component of treatment is to expose the person through a graduated exercise program and
increasing daily activities. The recommendations made in the past to rest and avoid activities will
only lengthen the duration of the illness and lead to more severe disability and handicap.
An essential component of the treatment of prolonged fatigue is to expose
the person to a graduated exercise program and to increase his or her daily
activities.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 181
1. Perform appropriate medical and psychiatric evaluation to note the presence of any of
the aetiological factors mentioned in Table 19-1. Avoid performing investigations and
making specialist referrals unless there are clear reasons for doing so. Make regular scheduled
appointments and encourage the person to consult only one doctor in order to avoid
duplication of investigations, adverse drug reactions and confused communication about the
nature of the problem.
2. Ask the patient to record his or her activities over a week using a daily activity schedule. This
will often reveal a pattern in which bouts of vigorous or prolonged activity are followed
by a worsening of fatigue symptoms, and then periods of rest and recovery. A vicious circle
is established in which the link between activity and fatigue is continually reinforced. An
important aim of treatment is to break this link. This is done by planning regular small
amounts of exercise every day rather than sudden bursts once a week. Patients are encouraged

to perform their planned activity even if they are feeling fatigued. On the other hand, they
are advised not to perform any vigorous or more demanding activity, even if they are feeling
very well.
3. Use a graduated exercise program to increase the person’s exercise tolerance. This part of
treatment involves exposing the person to the feared situation—in this case, the normal
physiological changes associated with aerobic exercise. The person learns that these changes
do not represent warning signs of physical illness. Exercise also has a beneficial effect on
mood.
4. Teach the patient response prevention to avoid checking behaviours (e.g. monitoring pulse
rate, weight, lymph nodes etc.) and seeking reassurance.
5. Demonstrate to the patient how focusing on a particular body part can induce symptoms.
6. Use structured problem solving to deal as effectively as possible with stressors in relationships
and at work (see Appendix 3).
7. Advise the person on good sleep habits (Table 14-3). People with chronic fatigue often have
an inconsistent sleep pattern, sleeping during the day and then staying up late. They may stay
up late over the weekend and then struggle to go to work on Monday morning. Negotiate
regular times for going to bed and rising.
8. Use cognitive behavioural techniques (see Chapter 10). Ask a (female) patient to make a diary,
noting the times when her fatigue is worst and recording her automatic thoughts at these
times. Help her to refute irrational thoughts and record changes in her symptoms. Uncover
underlying assumptions using the vertical arrow technique. These often include traits of
perfectionism, low self-esteem, excessive guilt and an excessive reliance on achievement.
9. Moclobemide may be effective in some patients.
Hypochondriasis
Like the other somatoform disorders, hypochondriasis is treated more often by general
practitioners than by psychiatrists. People with hypochondriasis are preoccupied with the
belief that they have a serious physical illness. The belief is maintained despite adequate medical
evaluation and explanation. Sufferers scan for information about the disorder, check frequently
for symptoms and signs, and seek repeated medical reviews. High levels of anxiety are common.
While the primary condition is relatively rare, symptoms of hypochondriasis often occur in
the context of depressive, anxiety and other mental disorders. In contrast to those suffering
unexplained physical symptoms, people with hypochondriasis, instead of being preoccupied
with particular somatic symptoms, are worried instead about having a particular illness.
Whereas people with unexplained physical symptoms are preoccupied with
their symptoms, people with hypochondriasis fear that they have a serious
physical illness.
Differential diagnosis
Hypochondriacal symptoms occur in a number of mental disorders. People with depression
are often concerned that they have some serious illness. In severe cases, a person may suffer
hypochondriacal delusions (e.g. that he or she has cancer or AIDS). Among the many concerns
of someone with generalised anxiety disorder are often fears of having a serious illness. During
a panic attack, a person may believe that he or she is going to die. Despite recognising the
irrationality of their thoughts, people with obsessive–compulsive disorder may be plagued by
fears of contracting a serious illness, and they may perform compulsive checking or cleaning
Somatoform disorders

rituals to avoid contamination. People with schizophrenia or delusional disorder may suffer
bizarre hypochondriacal delusions.
People with depressive and anxiety disorders often suffer hypochondriacal
symptoms.
Formulation
Biological factors
A history of prolonged or severe illness in childhood may be a predisposing factor. Recent severe
physical illness may also trigger hypochondriacal fears.
Psychosocial factors
As mentioned above, hypochondriacal complaints often occur in the context of some other
mental disorder, especially depression and anxiety. A parent or other family member with severe
illness may provide a model for the person with hypochondriasis. The meaning of the symptoms
for an individual may be an unconscious need for punishment, or a means of having dependency
needs met. The behaviour tends, on the one hand, to elicit people’s concern, but on the other
hand to frustrate and annoy them. The symptoms are reinforced by the secondary gains of
avoiding one’s normal responsibilities and gaining support and care from others. Reassurance
seeking behaviour is reinforced by the reduction in anxiety that it causes in the short-term.
However, over the long-term it leads to more disability and a need for repeated and more
frequent reassurance. A sample formulation is shown in Box 19-4.
Hypochondriacal symptoms may express an unconscious need for punishment, a
need to be cared for, or anger.
Treatment
1. People with hypochondriacal concerns are often dissatisfied with the medical care that they
have received in the past. Work to establish a therapeutic alliance by acknowledging the
person’s fears and symptoms. Take time to listen to the physical complaints. If the person
can learn to trust you, he or she is less likely to consult other doctors, and will avoid having
repeated investigations and procedures.
2. When presented with new symptoms, take a relevant history and perform a focused physical
examination, but be careful to avoid investigations unless clearly indicated. Similarly, avoid
specialist referral unless there are definite concerns about serious illness.
Box 19-4: Formulation of hypochondriasis
A 35-year-old woman presents acutely anxious. She is preoccupied with the fear that she may have
contracted AIDS after having an image of a bird tattooed on her shoulder two weeks before. She also
has a secret that she cannot tell you. A preliminary test for HIV comes back negative, but she feels that
she cannot cope having to wait another three months for a repeat test. Despite her anxiety, she can
still enjoy herself when distracted from her preoccupations, and she has not experienced any panic
attacks.
She always idolised her father, a large man with tattoos who used to work in the merchant navy.
However, she always felt rejected by him and resented the attention he paid to her brother with whom
he would go fishing, play cricket, and talk sport. Three months later, after the second HIV test, she
reveals the secret—she had been having an affair with a work colleague.
Comment: Her anxiety is magnified by the guilt over her marital infidelity. The tattoo was an act of
identification with her father. It may also have provided a more acceptable reason for presenting for
the HIV test than her sexual behaviour.
184
3. Diagnose and treat any primary or co-morbid conditions: depression, anxiety, alcohol and
substance abuse.
Depression, anxiety, alcohol and substance abuse can complicate
hypochondriasis.
4. Explain the relationship between mental states and the perception and interpretation of
physical symptoms. For example, a persistent preoccupation with having an illness can
lead to a focus on physical symptoms, which amplifies the perception of symptoms and
in turn leads to greater anxiety about having some serious illness. The vicious cycle can
be interrupted by an explanation of the problem, together with the use of relaxation and
distraction techniques.
5. Adopt a rehabilitation focus, aiming to help the person cope despite his or her fears.
Encourage the person to schedule pleasant activities every day that will distract him or her
from being preoccupied with illness. Self-monitoring while performing a graded exercise
program will often prove to patients that their disabilities are not as severe as they had
feared.
6. People with hypochondriasis generally do not respond well to reassurance. Indeed reassuranceseeking can be seen as a maladaptive response to the fear that one has a serious illness, similar
to the rituals of obsessive–compulsive disorder that are used to neutralise anxiety associated
with obsessions. Using the principles of exposure and response prevention described in
Chapter 9, the person should be exposed to symptoms through bodily focusing or exercise
without body checking or seeking reassurance. Family members should be encouraged to
minimise their reassuring behaviours and instead to reward healthy and adaptive activities.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 185
Sexual dysfunction
The prevalence of sexual problems in general practice populations has been estimated to be
around 15 per cent. The commonest problems amongst women who seek help are hypoactive
sexual desire disorder and female orgasmic disorder. Amongst men who present, erectile disorder
and premature ejaculation are the most frequent1
.
Ethical issues
Because of the intimate nature of sexual problems, those who provide sexual therapy must be
clear about relevant ethical and boundary issues.
1. In addition to the rules about not divulging information outside therapy, the therapist needs
to negotiate what information from individual therapy can be disclosed in couple therapy.
For example, if a (man) discloses that he is having an affair, sexual therapy is contraindicated,
and the therapist may find him/herself in the awkward position of having to inform the
man’s partner of this without stating the actual reason. Some therapists avoid this problem
by reaching an agreement that anything discussed in individual therapy can also be raised in
couple therapy.
2. It is essential to monitor your countertransference. Because of the intimate nature of sexual
therapy, together with the powerful position of the doctor/therapist with respect to the
patient, there are particular risks of boundary violations. A failure to acknowledge sexual
attraction to a person may lead to unnecessary physical examination. Unless you acknowledge
to yourself dislike of a patient, you may behave in a way that makes the person feel rejected
or demeaned. Make sure that any intervention you initiate is for sake of the patient(s) and
not for your own gratification.
3. Any sexual relationship between a therapist and a client within therapy can severely damage
the client. The therapist faces deregistration and possible criminal charges. The ban on sexual
relationships applies both during and after therapy.
4. There is no place for the direct observation of sexual behaviour in general practice settings.
Similarly, there should be no need for physical contact or demonstration of anatomy or
techniques. Written material and—if acceptable to the clients—videotapes can be used for
this purpose.
5. Informed consent should be obtained before performing a genital examination of an
individual of the opposite sex. The examination should be performed in the presence of a
clinician chaperone who is the same sex as the patient.
6. Care must be taken not to impose your values on the patient. For example, while it may
be reasonable to discuss a person’s aversion to oral sex, there should be no compulsion
upon him or her to perform it. If you feel uncomfortable with a couple’s values, refer them
elsewhere.
7. The therapist should not discuss his or her own sexual behaviour.
8. Before delivering sexual therapy, the therapist should first undergo supervised training.
Reading this text does not equip you to practise sexual therapy. However, you should be able
to talk about sexual issues with patients, recognise common problems, provide sex education
and advice on self-help texts, and make appropriate specialist referrals.

Any intervention must be for the benefit of the patient, not the therapist. It is
essential to monitor countertransference.
Assessment of sexual problems
Indications and contraindications
Sexual therapy is contraindicated if there are chronic marital problems with hostility and lack
of affection, ongoing infidelity or poor motivation. Couples with chronic marital problems
should first undergo marital therapy. Any severe psychiatric disorder will need to be treated
before sexual therapy begins. The presence of physical illness is not, in itself, a contraindication
to therapy. Sexual therapy is usually delayed until about six months after pregnancy. You need
to decide whether the problems reflect a sexual dysfunction or are due instead to unrealistic
expectations. Although the same principles apply to both heterosexual and homosexual couples,
see pp 199–200 for a discussion of specific issues that apply to homosexual couples.
Practical aspects of therapy
You will generally see the couple together and then separately. Promote a relaxed and trusting
atmosphere in which the couple feel comfortable discussing intimate parts of their lives. Monitor
the transference and countertransference, in particular, any impulse to avoid discussion of certain
topics out of shame or embarrassment. In order to avoid difficulties over confidentiality, it is
probably best to ask at the outset that anything said in individual therapy can also be discussed
in couple therapy. Reach a consensus on the sort of terminology you are going to use. Avoid
performance-based terms, such as ‘achieve’, ‘reach’ and ‘attain’. The interview skills mentioned
in Chapter 2, page 10, are applicable.
The interview
To clarify the presenting sexual complaint, you need to assess the associated physiological (e.g.
erectile difficulties), cognitive (e.g. negative thoughts, such as ‘I am going to fail again’) and
emotional (e.g. feeling anxious and down) components before, during and after having sex.
Identify the stage of the sexual response cycle at which problems occur and any relevant medical
drug history and past psychiatric history.
Try to answer the question, ‘Why is this couple presenting with these problems at this time?’
There may have been sexual problems for some years—why are they presenting now? Clarify the
time course and try to understand any precipitants and perpetuating factors. Ask the question,
‘What was happening around that time?’ rather than, ‘Why did the problems start?’
In addition to the general personal history covering early development, schooling, work, previous
relationships, leisure and interests, and religious or specific cultural issues, take a sexual history
that includes:
•	 family, religious and cultural attitudes to sex and sexual problems
•	 history of abuse or sexual assault
•	 age of first masturbation and the onset of menarche
•	 attitude to and feelings about the onset of puberty
•	 previous sexual relationships
•	 previous sexual dysfunction
•	 attitudes to aspects of sexuality such as nudity, masturbation, erotica and sexual fantasy
•	 sexual orientation
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 187
•	 attitude to pregnancy
•	 attitude to and fears about sexually transmitted diseases
•	 level of sexual knowledge and how it was obtained.
Assess general aspects of the current relationship—its length and history, the level of mutual
affection, shared interests, communication and relationships with children. Ask also about the
sexual relationship—its history, mutual attractiveness, communication about sexual matters and
infidelity. Assess each person’s motivation for treatment.
Perform a mental state examination, looking particularly for symptoms of depression or
anxiety.
Before performing a genital examination of an individual, you should first gain informed consent.
It is wise to have a health professional who is the same sex as the client present as a chaperone.
Look at the person’s general appearance noting particularly any stigmata of an endocrine
abnormality. Check blood pressure and peripheral pulses. Perform a genital examination noting
any anatomical abnormalities. Perform a vaginal examination.
Consider the following investigations: FSH, LH, prolactin and testosterone, fasting blood sugar,
and urine screen. Other tests such as penile plethysmography and vascular studies are left to a
specialist.
Formulation of sexual problems
A variety of biological and psychosocial factors can contribute to the development of sexual
problems. The formulation in a given individual or couple is never complete; rather, it develops
and becomes clearer as therapy progresses.
Biological factors
Neurological disorders
Sexual functioning involves the interaction of a complex array of cortical, brainstem,
parasympathetic (especially in arousal), sympathetic (especially in orgasm) and somatic neural
pathways. The impact of a spinal lesion will depend on its level and whether it is partial or
complete. Men with high spinal lesions may still have reflex erections. Frontal lobe stroke may
lead to sexual inhibition. Temporal lobe damage is usually associated with reduced sexual desire.
People with epilepsy, especially if there is involvement of the temporal lobes, may have reduced
sexual desire.
Vascular disorders
Blockage of arteries supplying the genital area leads to erectile dysfunction. Hypertension is
associated with erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory failure, problems that may be exacerbated
by anti-hypertensive medication. People who have suffered a myocardial infarction may avoid
sexual activity for fear of precipitating angina.
Endocrine disorders
Diabetes mellitus may lead to erectile difficulties due to peripheral neuropathy and vascular
abnormalities that worsen with illness duration. These may be exacerbated by psychological
reactions to early symptoms of the illness. Both Addison’s and Cushing’s diseases are associated
with reduced sexual desire. Klinefelter’s syndrome, cirrhosis, pituitary tumours, testicular
tumours, undescended testes and mumps orchitis are associated with loss of sexual desire, erectile
problems and ejaculatory failure. Hyperthyroidism is usually associated with reduced desire and
erectile problems though hyper-sexuality has been reported. Hypothyroidism is associated with
reduced sexual desire that may be partially reversible with treatment.
188
Genital problems
Vaginitis and venereal disease may cause local burning pain. Pelvic inflammatory disease,
endometriosis and ovarian tumours are associated with deep dyspareunia. Curvature of the penis
when erect in Peyronie’s disease may cause pain. Prostatism and venereal disease may present
with pain on ejaculation.
Other physical disorders
Arthritis may lead to sexual problems because of pain. Sjogren’s syndrome is associated with
dyspareunia due to impaired vaginal lubrication. Serious systemic diseases cause debility and
reduced sexual desire. Neoplasm may lead to sexual problems as direct or indirect effects of the
illness itself or its treatment, or because of psychological reactions to having the illness.
Drugs
A number of prescribed and recreational drugs can impair sexual functioning (See Table
20-1). Unfortunately, many psychotropic drugs produce significant sexual side effects. Amongst
the antidepressants, mirtazapine, moclobemide and nefazodone are generally least likely to
cause problems. The effects of SSRIs are dose-related, but resolve in around a third of patients.
Olanzapine or quetiapine are said to have few sexual side effects1
. However, note that responses
to specific drugs vary from one individual to another.
While alcohol in low doses decreases anxiety, at high doses it impairs erectile function, retards
ejaculation and reduces sexual desire. Cigarette smoking hastens atherosclerosis, which in turn
causes sexual dysfunction. There are conflicting reports about the effects of marijuana. Some
state that the drug enhances sexual experience; others that it can suppress testosterone levels.
Heroin is associated with a loss of sexual interest as well as erectile and ejaculatory impairment.

Psychosocial causes
Predisposing factors
People’s attitudes to sex are influenced by their upbringing and attitudes within their families of
origin. Relationships with parents and siblings influence later close relationships.
Young people who enter puberty earlier than their peers may feel ashamed and embarrassed.
Those with late puberty may feel ashamed and inadequate. The response of the child’s family is
an important mediating factor.
A person’s sexual knowledge, skills and ability to communicate about sex all contribute to the
quality of his or her sexual relations. A belief in certain sexual myths will affect a person’s sexual
behaviour. A person’s values and attitudes will influence his or her willingness to use sexual
fantasy and erotica, and may proscribe certain activities—for example, oral sex.
Difficulties in sexual functioning are important consequences of childhood sexual abuse. The
risk is increased if the abuse occurred at an older age, was frequent, and was associated with more
negative experiences, such as threats, coercion or dislike of the other person. Penetrative sexual
abuse is more traumatic than non-penetrative abuse.
Precipitating factors
Simple tiredness may be a significant contributing factor to sexual problems. The recommendation
to practice sensate focus and other exercises may only exacerbate the problem. Any general
stressor, such as the loss or death of a loved one, work difficulties or financial problems can have
an impact on sexual functioning. Physical illness may have a psychological impact in addition to
any direct physical impact. The discomfort that follows childbirth may persist and be complicated
by depression or fatigue. An episode of sexual failure may lead to persistent problems as a
consequence of performance anxiety. Couples undergoing invitro fertilisation treatment may
develop sexual problems in response to the diagnosis of infertility. Sexual behaviour may be
affected not only by the normal physiological changes of ageing, but exacerbated by negative
attitudes to ageing—for example, myths about sexuality being the exclusive domain of the young
and beautiful. After sexual assault, sexual problems are among the last symptoms of the trauma to
resolve. Behaviours that summon memories of the assault are especially likely to persist.
Perpetuating factors
Most couples with sexual problems also report marital difficulties1
. There may be difficulties
communicating about sexual matters, in particular, about one’s likes and dislikes. Episodes of
infidelity can lead to feelings of guilt, anger, resentment and inadequacy. The response of a
person’s partner to an episode of sexual dysfunction will influence his or her response to it. A
fear of intimacy or loss of attractiveness may play a part.
Underlying assumptions about sexuality, including beliefs in sexual myths (see following
page), influence sexual functioning. Some people find themselves more focused on observing
themselves and thinking about how they are performing than in enjoying the experience. A
couple’s sexual relationship will be affected by their access to a private, warm and comfortable
place. Tiredness and overwork are common precipitating and perpetuating factors.
Psychiatric disorders
Reduced sexual desire is a feature of depression. In mania, there may be disinhibition and an
increase in sexual behaviour that may later lead to shame and embarrassment. Schizophrenia is
generally associated with a reduced sexual desire. Anorexia nervosa is often associated with a loss
of interest in sex—the avoidance of mature female sexual functioning may contribute to the
genesis of the illness.

of Sex and Marital Therapy 1987; 13, 193-20.

General approaches to treatment
The following approaches are applicable to the treatment of most sexual problems. For some
patients, education and the provision of self-help texts may be the only interventions required.
Education
The aims of education are to provide new information, to dispel myths and misunderstandings,
to reduce anxiety and to increase the couple’s confidence. Patients should be asked to buy one of
the self-help texts mentioned on page 197. Negotiate the language you use and make sure that
any technical terms are understood. It is probably best to begin by using medical terminology
and then adapt your language to that used by the couple.
Educational interventions include providing new information, dispelling myths
and providing reference material.
Have some pictures demonstrating male and female anatomy. It is useful to begin by comparing
the general anatomy of the two and then to move on to the sexual anatomy. Discuss the normal
variation in the shape and size of secondary sexual characteristics. Explain the role of the clitoris
in orgasm. Note that the vagina is most sensitive at the entrance and that the inner two thirds are
sensitive mainly to pressure. Have some diagrams that illustrate internal sexual anatomy. Explain
the sexual response cycle—excitement, plateau, orgasm and resolution phases.
Address any myths that the couple have about sexual functioning (see below). Reassure people
about sex and ageing, in particular, that pleasurable sexual activity continues after menopause.
Some common sexual myths
Physical contact must always lead to sex.
Good sex must always end in orgasm.
Good sex equals intercourse.
The man should always take the lead.
Sex should always be spontaneous.
A man should not express his feelings.
A man should be ready for sex at any time.
An erection should be there for the duration of sexual activity.
A woman should not initiate sex.
A woman should not enjoy sex too much, masturbate or use a vibrator.
Men and women today are no longer influenced by old-fashioned sex-role stereotypes.
Couples should have sex several times a week.
Couples should always have orgasm simultaneously.
A person should know intuitively what his or her partner wishes without being told.
A woman should always be prepared to have sex if her partner wants it.
A woman should be able to have an orgasm without direct stimulation of her clitoris.
A woman should have an orgasm every time she has sex.

Promoting a positive sexual attitude
Making love does not necessarily involve sexual intercourse, orgasm or ejaculation. Warwick
Williams formulates the ‘key sexual attitude’ as, ‘Lovemaking means literally that—interacting
physically and emotionally with someone you care about. Arousal, intercourse and orgasms are
non-essential and simply possible lovemaking options’.1
 He recommends a number of exercises
that promote this attitude—making love at times when you do not feel like it, but are also not
strongly averse to it; monitoring yourself for negative thoughts about sexual performance and
using cognitive restructuring to correct these thoughts; discussing with your partner what you
think and how you feel when he or she wants to have sex but you do not; discussing with
your partner the positive side of lovemaking that does not involve sexual intercourse (e.g. no
performance anxiety, does not matter if you are tired, there are more opportunities); discussing
the truth of the key sexual attitude with others; using autosuggestion (e.g. after performing a
relaxation exercise, repeating to oneself a positive, affirming thought such as, ‘Having sex is just
one of many ways of expressing love’); and repeating such a thought six times on a given cue
(e.g. every time you have a drink).
The key sexual attitude is that lovemaking is not just about genital sexual
relations, but rather, interacting physically and emotionally with someone you
love.
Structured problem solving
This is discussed in Chapter 6. Here is an example applied to the treatment of a sexual
problem.
Nigel and Polly have had difficulties in their sexual relationship since Nigel’s mother, Margaret,
moved in six months ago. They formulate the problem as follows: ‘We need to find more private
time together’.
They generate the following possible solutions:
1
 Williams W. Man, Woman and Sexual Desire. Sydney: Williams and Wilkins, 1986, p130.
192
•	 Margaret to spend one night a week with Nigel’s brother, Martin
•	 Margaret to live with Martin
•	 Nigel and Polly to go out together once a week
•	 Margaret to move out to a retirement village
They decide on the third option. The steps they need to take are for Nigel to check his afterhours roster to make sure he has every Thursday off; Polly to book a table at a restaurant; and
Nigel to talk to Margaret about what she would like to do on Thursday nights.
A month later, Margaret is spending every Thursday night with Martin and his family. Nigel and
Polly usually pick her up on their way from their night out. Last week they went to the theatre,
the first time for either of them in the past five years. They report improvements in both their
general relationship and their sexual relationship.

sexual therapy are given in Table 2.

Doctor Black says this is not such an uncommon
problem and treatment is very successful.
Mark suffers impotence. During sensate focus
exercises, he thinks:
I’m a loser.
Bernice only says I’m attractive because she feels
sorry for me.
(labelling)
I have a problem, but I am working at it. The
doctor says there are good success rates, and
Bernice is keen to help. Our marriage is strong
and our children are doing well.
(refusing to accept praise)
I may not be a model, but a number of others
have commented on my good looks.
Sexual dysfunction
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 193
Marital therapy interventions
Sexual problems may be one manifestation of marital difficulties. If the marriage problem is
severe and there is a lack of affection between the couple, then sexual therapy is contraindicated.
However, mild degrees of marital discord can be dealt with during sexual therapy. For a discussion
of marital therapy techniques, see pages 47-49. An example of reciprocal negotiation is given
below:
Judith and Andrew are each asked to make a list of things that they would like the other to
do for them. These wishes should be relatively easy to perform and low in cost.
Judith’s list includes the following:
Go out to the movies together next week.
Be in bed by 10.30pm.
Give her a kiss before leaving for work and on arriving home.
Go for a walk in the botanical gardens at the weekend.
Andrew’s list includes:
Give him a back rub.
Prepare a meal for the visit of an old friend.
Arrange to be home early one night a week so he can go to indoor cricket.
Encourage him to go to indoor cricket.
Non-genital sensate focus
The aims of this exercise are to improve trust between the couple, to help them feel relaxed
in situations of physical intimacy, and to promote communication about how they are feeling
during sexual activity. The immediate aim is not sexual intercourse, or even sexual arousal;
indeed, the couple is asked to abstain from sexual intercourse during this stage of therapy.
Instead, they aim to provide pleasure to each other through caressing parts of the body other
than the genitals and female breasts. They take turns in providing pleasure to the other through
caressing, kissing or the use of oils or lotion.
One of the most important components of this exercise is the promotion of communication
between the couple. The (woman) receiving the caresses should communicate how she feels
and what gives her pleasure. She may guide her partner’s hand. She may state what she prefers
and whether she would like it done softer, harder, faster or slower. The (man) giving the caresses
should observe his partner and learn to pick up her cues.
The couple need to find around 40 minutes at least three times a week to practice this exercise.
They need a quiet, warm place where they will not be interrupted. Because of their anxiety,
some couples may need to begin the exercise clothed or in a darkened room. They then work
step by step towards providing each other with pleasure while naked in a softly lit room.
If one or other of the individuals is overworked or tired, practising this exercise may only
exacerbate the problem—deal with the tiredness and its causes first.
The initiator of the exercise might be chosen by a toss of a coin. However, if one partner is
particularly anxious, feels pressured or is habitually the one who agrees to rather than initiates
sex, then he or she begins as the initiator.
After around 10 minutes the roles of giver and receiver of pleasure should be reversed. Both
will then have two turns in each role. Ask clients to note the feelings and thoughts they have
during the exercise and use this as material for cognitive restructuring (see Chapter 10). The
couple should not proceed to genital sensate focus exercises until both feel relaxed performing
this exercise.
194
Genital sensate focusing
The emphasis is again on giving and receiving pleasure rather than on arousal. However, in this
exercise, the couple also stimulate each other’s genitals. The ban on sexual intercourse remains. An
essential component is the ability to communicate during sexual relations. The (man) receiving
the caresses should provide feedback to his partner about how he feels and what he likes. He
may guide her hand. Contact proceeds from gentle stroking of the thighs and abdomen to
genital caresses. Initially, one partner alternates with the other, but later the couple may provide
pleasure to each other at the same time.
Sensate focus exercises aim to remove anxiety about sexual performance
through a focus on giving and receiving pleasure without necessarily proceeding
to sexual intercourse.
Diagnosis and treatment of specific conditions
For a diagnosis to be made, the symptoms must be persistent or recurrent, and cause significant
distress, disability and handicap.
Mismatched libidos
This does not appear in the DSM-IV, but may be one of the commonest presentations of sexual
problems. Although each member of the couple has normal sexual desire, there is a mismatch
between the two.1
Although each member of a couple may have a normal sexual desire, they may
be mismatched.
Treatment
•	 Consider the differential diagnoses – hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual aversion disorder,
female sexual arousal disorder and male erectile disorder (see below)
•	 Use exercises to promote a positive sexual attitude, as discussed above.
•	 Develop an understanding of three possible situations and how to deal with them2
:
◊	 The couple both feel like having sex at the same time. Apart from the early stages of a
relationship, this situation is uncommon.
◊	 One partner is in the mood for sex, but the other, while not being actively averse to it,
is not. This is probably the commonest situation. The person is encouraged to make love,
but with no promise that it will lead to sexual intercourse. For example, he or she may
relieve the partner’s sexual arousal through manual stimulation or the use of a vibrator.
◊	 One partner feels actively averse to having sex. In this situation, it is essential that (he)
is able to decline lovemaking. (He) might use a passive means of providing relief to his
partner—for example, by using a vibrator. Alternatively, (he) communicates, without
apology, but also without anger, that (he) cannot make love now.
Hypoactive sexual desire disorder
The essential feature is a lack of sexual fantasy and desire for sexual activity. It may be pervasive
1
 Williams W. Man, Woman and Sexual Desire. Sydney: Williams and Wilkins, 1986. 2
 ibid.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 195
or only occur in specific situations, or be limited to one partner or one sexual activity. It is often
associated with reduced arousal and difficulties with orgasm.
Treatment
Because of the many possible causes of this problem, it is essential to make a comprehensive
formulation in order to individualise treatment.
• Use the general approaches to treatment mentioned above – education, developing the ‘key
sexual attitude’, marital therapy, structured problem solving, cognitive behavioural approaches
and sensate focus.
• In some cases, it may be possible to increase the number of opportunities for heightened
sexual desire—for example, by organising nights out together or, if acceptable to the couple,
through the use of fantasy or erotica.
Sexual Aversion Disorder
This involves an aversion to and active avoidance of genital contact with the person’s sexual
partner. Facing a sexual situation, he or she may suffer anxiety, panic attacks or feelings of
disgust.
Treatment
The principles of treatment are the same as for phobias (see pages 145–147).
• Use non-specific approaches as above – education, structured problem solving, cognitive
behavioural therapy, marital therapy and sensate focus.
• The cornerstone of treatment is graduated exposure. A hierarchy of feared situations is
compiled that is specific to the individual. For example, one woman may be primarily afraid
of becoming pregnant, while another may have an aversion to semen. After being taught
methods of relaxation (see Appendices 4, 5 and 6), the person is exposed to feared situations
progressing from the least to the most feared. Therapy may also progress from exposure in
imagination to exposure in vivo. It is important that anxiety is reduced on exposure to each
step (desensitisation) before progression to the next stage. If the person cannot tolerate the
next step and escapes from it, the reduction in anxiety negatively reinforces avoidance. The
use of benzodiazepines is discouraged.
The principles of treatment of sexual aversion disorder are the same as for
phobias.
Female sexual arousal disorder
This is characterised by a failure of normal physiological changes in response to sexual arousal:
pelvic vasocongestion, vaginal lubrication and swelling of the external genitalia. An essential text
is Heiman, Lopiccolo and Lopiccolo’s book1
.
Treatment
The specific techniques used in a particular case will depend on the individual formulation.
• Use non-specific approaches as above – education, promoting the ‘key sexual attitude’,
structured problem solving, cognitive behavioural therapy, marital therapy and sensate focus.
• The woman is encouraged to practise masturbation exercises. When she can arouse herself
by this means, her partner becomes involved, initially observing her stimulate herself and
later being guided by her to provide stimulation as part of genital sensate focus exercises.
1
 Heiman JR, LoPiccolo L, LoPiccolo J. Becoming Orgasmic: a Sexual Growth Programme for Women.
Englewood Cliffs, Prentice-Hall, 1976.
196
If acceptable, a vibrator can be used. The couple then proceed to sexual intercourse. This
should first involve only vaginal containment of the penis with the woman providing clitoral
stimulation.
• For post-menopausal women, a vaginal cream may be prescribed to enhance lubrication.
Oestrogen creams may be prescribed.
• Negative cognitions may include negative beliefs about a woman masturbating, especially
in front of her partner; the man may feel a failure for being unable to satisfy his partner.
The cognitive restructuring needs to be approached sensitively with care taken to take into
account the value systems of the individuals involved.
Masturbation exercises are the cornerstone of the treatment of female sexual
arousal disorder.
Male erectile disorder
This involves a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or sustain an erection during sexual
activity. In the DSM-IV, the condition is distinguished from sexual dysfunction due to a general
medical condition. However, both physiological and psychological factors are often involved.
Treatment
• Treat any underlying physical condition.
• Use non-specific techniques – education, promotion of the ‘key sexual attitude’, structured
problem solving and relationship counselling as above.
• The couple begin with sensate focus exercises, at first with the additional request that the
man tries not to develop an erection, but rather focuses on the pleasure his partner provides.
This reduces performance anxiety and self-observation, and encourages him to focus instead
on receiving pleasure. The exercise is often best performed in the morning when the man’s
erection at its firmest. His partner may use gels or lubricants, or perform oral sex.
• The couple cease penile stimulation when the man has a firm erection, allow the erection
to subside, and then repeat the process two or three times. This exercise helps reduce anxiety
about losing an erection.
• In some cases, the anxiety is around maintaining an erection on vaginal penetration. The man
should first practise ejaculating outside the vagina. Next, his partner progresses from rubbing
his penis against her clitoris, to vaginal containment, and then to thrusting and completion of
intercourse.
• Cognitive approaches may be used to address thoughts associated with performance anxiety.
Physical treatments
Sildenafil (Viagra) is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5, the enzyme that breaks down cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This in turn maintains arteriolar relaxation, mediated by nitric
oxide, and so increases the duration and rigidity of erections in response to sexual stimulation. The
dose is between 25mg and 100mg taken around one hour before sexual intercourse. Inhibitors
of CYP3A4, including cimetidine, erythromycin and ketoconazole, slow its breakdown. It is
contraindicated within 24 hours of taking nitrates (therapeutically for cardiovascular disease
or recreationally as amyl nitrate). It should be used with care in men in whom sexual activity
may precipitate adverse cardiovascular events, and in those with degenerative retinal disorders.
Side effects include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, diarrhoea and visual changes
including a blue aura. Research into the use of sildenafil for women with sexual problems is
under investigation.
Sexual dysfunction
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 197
Other physical treatments include intracavernosal injection of alprostadil (Caverject), transurethral
alprostadil administered via a micro-suppository, vacuum constriction devices, vascular surgery
and penile implants. Note that men with low testosterone suffer low sexual desire and rarely
present complaining of erectile dysfunction.
Contraindications to the use of sildenafil include the use of nitrates, severe
cardiovascular disease and degenerative retinal disorders.
Female orgasmic disorder
This involves a persistent or recurrent delay in or absence of orgasm.
Treatment
• The woman is usually seen on her own at the beginning of treatment. A useful self-help guide
is Heiman, LoPiccolo and LoPiccolo’s book1
.
• Non-specific approaches include education and a discussion of her sexual attitudes.
• She is asked to examine and to become relaxed about her own body. She is then asked to note
three positive and three negative things about her body.
• The next step is genital self-examination. She begins by identifying the different parts of her
genital anatomy. She records her feelings and thoughts during self-examination, which then
form material for cognitive restructuring. She then begins to explore herself with a finger.
She should not be trying to produce an orgasm at this stage.
• Practice Kegel exercises. These involve recognising, gaining control of, and strengthening, the
pubococcygeal muscles—those that interrupt micturition.
• She is then asked to identify sensitive spots, including the clitoris, and to proceed to
masturbation. She may use erotica, fantasy or a vibrator.
• Once she is able to produce an orgasm through self-stimulation, her partner can be involved.
She may begin by stimulating herself to orgasm in his presence and then by showing him
what gives her pleasure. During sexual intercourse, she continues to stimulate her clitoris.
The couple may then cease clitoral stimulation just before orgasm. However, a percentage of
women will not experience orgasm by vaginal penetration alone, continuing to require some
clitoral stimulation.
• Issues that may be relevant in cognitive restructuring include the belief that self-stimulation
is not acceptable, that one’s genitals are ugly, that a woman should be able to orgasm through
vaginal stimulation alone, and fears of loss of control. The partner’s attitudes may also need to
be addressed; for example the belief that he is inadequate if he cannot stimulate his partner to
orgasm.
Male orgasmic disorder
The disorder is sometimes referred to as inhibited or retarded ejaculation. It most commonly
occurs in the context of sexual intercourse. Most men can experience orgasm from masturbation
or from manual stimulation by their partners.
Treatment
• Treatment involves a graduated series of activities that move towards sexual intercourse. The
man may begin with self-stimulation alone and then, in the presence of his partner. They then
proceed to sensate focus exercises. Lubricants can be used as well as fantasy and erotica. The
1

Prentice-Hall, 1976.
198
couple then move to sexual intercourse with the man masturbating and then inserting his
penis just before ejaculation.
• Negative cognitions that can impair orgasm include a fear of loss of control, a fear of pregnancy
and negative responses to genitals.
• In cases where there are specific phobias, treatment proceeds as for sexual aversion disorder
(see page 195).
Premature ejaculation
The main feature is ejaculation after minimal stimulation, or before or shortly after penetration.
Premature ejaculation is often experienced by young men during their first attempts at
intercourse, but is only a problem if it persists.
Treatment
• The stop-start technique begins with the man attending to his level of arousal during
masturbation, in particular, identifying the point of ejaculatory inevitability. He then practises
ceasing self-stimulation just before this point is reached, allowing his arousal to subside
before repeating the exercise. A similar progression it then practised with his partner. At
first, the partner provides manual stimulation. Intercourse begins with brief containment and
withdrawal. The times of penetration and the vigour of movements of penis in vagina then
gradually increase.
• The squeeze technique is only indicated if the stop-start exercise is unsuccessful. The penis
is grasped with the thumb on the fraenulum and index and middle finger across the coronal
sulcus, and squeezed for around 5–10 seconds during high arousal. It is advisable to test the
pressure required on the erect penis prior to practising the exercise.
Dyspareunia
This refers to pain experienced during intercourse.
Treatment
• Treat any physical cause. Common causes include vaginal infection, venereal disease and
inadequate lubrication. Causes of deep dyspareunia include endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory
disease and ovarian tumour.
• Use non-specific techniques including education, relationship counselling (where applicable),
relaxation and structured problem solving.
• When the pain is the result of impaired arousal, use the sensate focus exercises as discussed
above.
• Give advice on positions that limit penetration, such as rear-entry and side-by-side.
• Practise Kegel exercises to enhance muscle control.
• Typical cognitive distortions include fears that one’s genitals are abnormal, or of falling
pregnant. The partner may fear harming her.
Vaginismus
The characteristic feature is the involuntary contraction of the muscles of the outer third of the
vagina on vaginal penetration. It is commoner in young women and is associated with negative
attitudes to sex and with past sexual abuse.
Differential diagnosis
Vaginismus may complicate any of the physical disorders that cause dyspareunia.
Treatment
• Treat the underlying medical condition
• Non-specific approaches include education, relaxation training and relationship counselling
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 199
where applicable.
• Construct a hierarchy of activities that successively approximate full penetration. Begin with
self-observation and self-touching and move towards the insertion of one, two and then
three fingers. The partner is then involved. Follow a similar progression during genital sensate
focus.
The treatment of vaginismus includes progression through a hierarchy of
activities that eventually lead to full penetration.
Referral
Unless you have undergone some supervised training in sexual therapy it is probably best to
limit yourself to the provision of information and recommendation of self-help manuals.
Indications for referral include the following:
• if you dislike or are sexually attracted to an individual
• if you are uncomfortable with the values or practices of the clients; for example, if you are
uncomfortable treating a homosexual couple
• where the problems are long-standing, severe and have not responded to treatment
• where an individual has a history of serious sexual abuse
• if complications develop during treatment, such as serious marital discord
• in complex cases where multiple problems coexist
• if you do not feel confident in offering therapy.
A note on testosterone treatment
Testosterone can only be prescribed on an authority script to males with androgen deficiency with
established pituitary or testicular disorders; to males under 18 with micropenis or constitutional
delay of growth or puberty; or to males 40 years and older without these disorders, with at least
two morning blood samples taken on different mornings in which testosterone is less than 8
nmol per L, or 8–15 nmol per L if LH is greater than 1.5 times the normal range. It is a soughtafter drug of abuse. It is advisable to check pituitary function to clarify whether any dysfunction
is at the level of the pituitary or the testes. Low testosterone causes low libido; sufferers rarely
present complaining of erectile problems. Men prescribed testosterone should be warned about
hypogonadism, which may persist for more than 12 months after the cessation of treatment.
The main presenting complaint of men with hypogonadism is low sexual desire.
Homosexual patients
The problems that homosexual couples most often present with are the same as for heterosexuals
and the principles of treatment are the same. If you are uncomfortable with homosexuality, you
should refer them elsewhere. Because of ingrained negative attitudes to homosexuality, be careful
to monitor your countertransference in dealing with homosexual clients. Some specific issues
with regard to the treatment of male and female homosexual couples are discussed below.
If you are uncomfortable with homosexuality, refer homosexual couples
presenting with sexual problems to a colleague with expertise in this area.
200
Homosexual females
The commonest reasons for presentation are low frequency of genital sexual activity and
mismatched sexual desire. As with other couples, treatment may primarily involve education
and reassurance1
.
Myths that can be addressed through cognitive restructuring include:
• Because I am a woman, I must know what my partner likes without asking her.
• Other lesbian couples have sex more often than we do.
• Women should not take the initiative in sexual encounters.
The internalisation of societal homophobic attitudes may lead to low self-esteem and inhibited
sexual activity and behaviour. It may be associated with the following negative beliefs:
• If I am not sexually active, I am not really homosexual.
• If I take a passive role, I am not really lesbian.
Useful references include books by Loulan2
 and Barbach3
.
Homosexual males
The commonest problem that leads homosexual men to seek help is erectile dysfunction. While
most sexual problems presented by homosexual men are similar to those of heterosexual men,
some specific differences are discussed below.
Gay sex includes mutual masturbation, oral and anal sex. Anal spasm is treated through the
exclusion of physical causes (e.g. anal fissure), the provision of information, giving permission,
and graduated insertion exercises similar to the treatment of vaginismus. Problems in sexual
arousal may follow from demands for rapid response to sexual approaches in gay meeting places.
On one hand, the individual may be opposed to this sort of activity in which sex is separated
from intimacy or love. On the other hand, difficulties may develop in primary relationships
because of fears of intimacy. A fear of contracting HIV infection may also play a part. Internalised
homophobic attitudes can be addressed through cognitive restructuring. Many homosexual men
continue to wrestle with their sexual identity.
There are often particular pressures on homosexual relationships. Gay male relationships are
more at risk than heterosexual marriages. Moreover, gay partners are said to be more likely
to have relationships outside a primary relationship4
. Concerns about how gay couples will
be accepted by friends, family and other members of society may lead to anxiety about being
discovered and a desire to maintain secrecy. Many homosexuals remain single. Others may marry,
but continue to have homosexual fantasies and involve themselves in covert sexual activities.
Sexual therapy in other special populations
For a discussion of special aspects of sexual therapy in the elderly, the intellectually disabled and
the physically disabled, I refer the reader to Spence’s book5
. Sexual therapy in a transcultural
setting is discussed in D’Ardenne’s paper6

Trauma, memory and dissociation
The dissociative disorders are the subject of increasing attention in psychiatric research and
clinical practice. Among psychiatric in-patients, their prevalence has been estimated to be
around 5 per cent. A surprising finding of the National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing
was that the commonest anxiety disorder in the adult population, with a 12-month prevalence
of 3.3 per cent1
 was post-traumatic stress disorder. Dissociative disorders are generally regarded
as being among the post-traumatic syndromes: others include post-traumatic stress disorder
(Chapter 15), borderline personality disorder (Chapter 23) and some of the somatoform
disorders (Chapter 19). People who repeatedly self-harm have often been the victims of abuse
(Chapter 3).Pure dissociative disorders are rare; more commonly, people present with a variety
of dissociative, somatoform, anxiety and depressive symptoms, sometimes associated with selfharming behaviour and, in some cases, in the context of a personality disorder.
The place of trauma in the aetiology of these disorders remains controversial. Indeed, there
is a history of fluctuations between periods of acceptance and repudiation of the disorders
themselves. Freud, in his early formulation of hysterical phenomena, attributed the symptoms to
early trauma, especially childhood sexual abuse. However, he later rejected the ‘seduction theory’
and postulated instead that the memories of his patients were the result of fantasy rather than
of actual events. In legal settings, doctors are sometimes asked to give an opinion on whether
traumatic memories are the result of past abuse, of conscious or unconscious fabrication, the
result of suggestion from an over-zealous therapist, or some combination of these.
The most recent demonstration of this controversy has been the debate over false memory
syndrome. In a number of highly publicised cases, legal action was taken against alleged
perpetrators of child sexual abuse, often family members of the complainant, on the basis of
memories of abuse that were recovered during therapy. The legal process forced a polarisation
of opinion on whether or not the abuse actually occurred. The devastating effects of these cases,
irrespective of the legal outcome, further polarise the debate.
Most writers presently agree on the centrality of traumatic experiences in the aetiology of
these disorders. However, it should be remembered that reactions to stress and trauma vary
considerably from one person to another. Some individuals develop dissociative disorders or
other post-traumatic syndromes after exposure to relatively minor trauma, while others cope
with severe and prolonged trauma without developing a post-traumatic syndrome.
In this chapter, I first briefly review evidence of the profound effect of psychological trauma on
memory. I then discuss the assessment and diagnosis of dissociative disorders and the principles
of their treatment. Although general practitioners will not be expected to provide this treatment,
they should nevertheless be able to make the diagnosis and to refer patients appropriately. They
should be aware of the difficult transference and countertransference responses that can occur
when dealing with these people, and they should consider these disorders in the differential
diagnoses of other disorders, including psychotic disorders, with which they may be confused.
General practitioners need to be able to diagnose dissociative disorders,
consider them in the differential diagnosis of psychotic disorders, and be aware
of common countertransference responses to people who suffer from them.

Effects of trauma on memory
There is ample evidence of the profound effect that severe psychological trauma has on memory.
Much of this evidence comes from case reports of soldiers diagnosed with shell shock during
the First World War. There are similar reports of people involved in other military conflicts, and
of victims of natural disasters, torture, child sexual abuse and personal violence.
Trauma has profound effects on memory. An inability to voluntarily recall
traumatic events is coupled to an unconscious recall of these events in dreams,
re-enactments and flashbacks.
On one hand, there is often an inability to consciously recall events. The amnesia may be for the
specific event, but can also be for longer periods. In psychogenic fugue, the sufferer is unable to
recall basic facts of his or her personal history and identity. On the other hand, the events are
engraved in memory and find expression in dreams, re-enactments and flashbacks. Cues to the
trauma may trigger these painful memories.
At the time of the traumatic event, dissociation is adaptive, because it isolates
the person from an otherwise intolerable experience.
Dissociation is a psychological process through which traumatic memories, physical sensations,
affects and ideas are stored and processed separately from, and are partially or completely
inaccessible to, the rest of conscious experience. At the time of a traumatic experience, this
process is adaptive, because it isolates the person from an event that might otherwise overwhelm
him or her. He or she may even experience the event as if it is happening to another person.
However, in the long term, a failure to integrate the experience within the person’s life story
may lead to serious disability and handicap (see Box 21-1).
Assessment
Consider the following four core dissociative symptoms:
•	 amnesia – People with dissociative disorders may have gaps in memory or a sense of having
‘lost time’. They may lose track of conversations, or reach the destination of a journey and
forget how they got there. As mentioned above, amnesia may be accompanied by flashbacks
of traumatic events. Traumatic amnesia needs to be distinguished from simple forgetting, or
failure to encode information due to impaired concentration.
•	 depersonalisation – This is an unpleasant feeling of being detached from oneself. A man may
feel as if he is standing beside himself observing his own actions. The observing self may be
heard commenting on the participating self (pseudohallucination). People with dissociative
disorders often have difficulty describing the experience. The process may be adaptive during
Box 21-1: Post-traumatic stress disorder
An army sergeant is amnesic for a traumatic combat experience. He suffers flashbacks in which he
is immobilised with fear as he re-experiences a battle scene. He sleeps poorly and is irritable and
aggressive. He uses alcohol to lessen his constant anxiety. While serving in Vietnam, his platoon was
ambushed and a friend lay dying just five meters from him. He was unable to give any assistance
because of enemy fire that continued until relief arrived two hours later. By this time, his friend had
died.
Comment: Central to his role as a platoon commander are his leadership skills and his ability to stay
calm in a crisis. The feelings of shame, guilt and helplessness that he experienced during combat are in
conflict with this part of his identity.
Trauma, memory and dissociation
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 203
exposure to a traumatic event, since it distances the person from involvement in the event and
the associated pain, emotional distress and personal meaning.
•	 derealisation – The person feels detached from the outside world, which seems unreal, unfamiliar
and strange. Events may appear slowed down. Sounds may be muffled. Derealisation often
accompanies depersonalisation.
•	 identity confusion/alteration – The person lacks a coherent sense of who he or she is. A man
may feel that he must act like someone else in social or work situations. There may be
confusion over sexual identity. In cases of dissociative identity disorder, there may be separate
personalities (alters) each with different names and distinctive attitudes and skills. The alters
may be variably amnesic for the presence and actions of each other.
Consider the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder in people who have had a large number of
diagnoses in the past. Have a high index of suspicion when assessing people with a cluster of
somatoform and mood symptoms such as headaches (including migraine), recurrent pelvic and
abdominal pain, chronic fatigue, mood instability, self-harming, anxiety symptoms and eating
disorders.
Consider the diagnosis of a dissociative disorder in people presenting with a
cluster of the following symptoms: headaches (including migraine), recurrent
abdominal pain, chronic fatigue, mood instability, anxiety and eating disorders.
The victims of trauma often suffer low self-esteem with strong feelings of guilt and shame
over the traumatic events. Even those who suffered abuse as a child often feel that they were
somehow to blame. At the time of the event, they were powerless to influence what happened,
but being entirely dependent on the abusers, they may have had no choice but to believe that
they were at fault.
Formulation
The likelihood of developing a post-traumatic syndrome increases with the intensity and
duration of exposure to a trauma. Vulnerability to dissociative disorders and other posttraumatic
syndromes also includes genetic and a number of other biological factors, including certain
neuro-endocrine factors. Psychological factors that predispose to their development include
certain personality traits (neuroticism and introversion), a history of mental illness, and past
exposure to trauma. Social factors include a history of negative parenting, early separation from
parents and low levels of education. A high level of social supports in the aftermath of a trauma
is protective.
The social relationships of abused people may continue to be influenced by past trauma. Through
repetition compulsion, the person may continue to be revictimised, or through identification
with the aggressor, the person may go on to abuse others (see Box 21-2).
Box 21-2: Repetition compulsion and identification with the aggressor
• A young woman, who as a child was a victim of sexual abuse by her stepfather, works as a prostitute
and lives with a man who physically abuses her.
Comment: The stepfather, despite being abusive, was a central nurturing figure in her upbringing
and has set the model for the sort of people she will seek out in future intimate relationships
(repetition compulsion).
• The father under investigation for abuse of his four-year-old son was himself the victim of physical
abuse by his alcoholic father.
Comment: He has identified with his father (identification with the aggressor).
204
People abused as children may later be victimised by abusive partners.
Diagnosis and differential diagnosis
The DSM-IV includes several dissociative disorders. Dissociative amnesia involves an inability
to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too
extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. Dissociative fugue is characterised by
unexpected travel away from home with an inability to recall one’s past. Dissociative identity
disorder, DID (previously called multiple personality disorder) is characterised by the presence of
two or more distinct identities or personality states that recurrently take control of the individual’s
behaviour. Depersonalisation disorder involves a feeling of being detached from one’s mental
processes or body. However, it is rare for people to present with one of these syndromes alone.
More commonly, people present with a combination of dissociative, somatoform, anxiety and
depressive symptoms.
In general practice settings, dissociative symptoms most commonly occur in
combination with somatoform, anxiety and depressive symptoms.
There is considerable overlap between the symptoms of dissociative disorders and other
posttraumatic syndromes. Post-traumatic stress disorder often involves amnesia and re-enactment
together with symptoms of increased arousal and avoidance of stimuli associated with the
disorder. Borderline personality disorder may be associated with a history of child sexual abuse
and is characterised by a dysregulation of emotional control. Dissociative symptoms may occur
in the context of anxiety and depressive disorders or be co-morbid with these disorders. People
with more complex dissociative conditions who have a history of childhood abuse also have
high frequencies of non-organic pain, conversion symptoms and other physical complaints.
Other disorders that may arise as sequelae to traumatic experiences include
post-traumatic stress disorder, borderline personality disorder, anxiety
disorders, depression and the syndromes of unexplained physical symptoms.
Amnestic syndromes may be confused with organic mental disorders and substance abuse
disorders. However, in these disorders there will be a defined physical cause and more global
cognitive dysfunction. It is often more difficult to distinguish dissociation, especially in its
more florid manifestations, from psychotic disorders. The full range of first rank symptoms of
schizophrenia has been described in people with dissociative identity disorder. However, people
with dissociative disorders rarely exhibit the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (amotivation,
apathy, social withdrawal and anhedonia).
People with severe dissociative disorders can suffer a variety of symptoms
typical of psychotic disorders.
Treatment
Therapy with people who suffer dissociative disorders is difficult and generally best left to a
specialist in the area. Some will not be able to engage in any reconstructive therapy and are
instead offered support, counselling and structured problem solving (see Chapters 6 and 8). It is
desirable for these patients to form a therapeutic alliance with one general practitioner in order
to avoid the iatrogenic complications of somatisation, including multiple investigations and
procedures. Close liaison between the general practitioner and the therapist is essential.
Trauma, memory and dissociation
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 205
The general practitioner should try to establish a therapeutic alliance with the
patient with a dissociative disorder, avoid unnecessary investigations of somatic
complaints, and work in close liaison with the person’s therapist.
Psychotherapy for dissociative disorders can be divided into three stages: providing safety and
stability; recovering and processing the traumatic memories; and reintegrating the person’s sense
of identity and enhancing his or her ability to lead a fulfilling life and make enduring friendships.
Helping the person process the traumatic event is best left to a specialist therapist. A person
should never be forced to relive past trauma. This can be unbearable for him or her and may
even constitute re-traumatisation.
The therapist should never force a person to relive past traumatic experiences.
This can be unbearable and constitute re-traumatisation.
Safety and stability
People presenting with dissociative disorders for the first time are often in crisis. The principles
of crisis intervention described in Chapter 6 are applicable here. In the face of frightening
nightmares and flashbacks, and the negative reactions of other people to her behaviour, a young
woman with dissociative symptoms is at risk of self-harm or suicide. Try to establish a therapeutic
alliance by listening to her complaints, empathising with her suffering and promoting trust
and hope. Simple grounding techniques may be useful if she begins to dissociate during the
interview—ask her to let her hands feel the chair on which she is sitting, feel the floor through
her shoes, open her eyes, look at you, and state her name and address.
Grounding techniques for a (woman) in crisis include asking her to let her
hands feel the chair, feel the floor through her shoes, open her eyes, look at
you, and state her name and address.
When dealing with someone with dissociative identity disorder it is important to recognise the
different alters while, at the same time, reinforcing the fact that they exist within one person. You
might address yourself to ‘you all’, or you might ask the alter in control to communicate with the
other alters. Establish an agreement with all of the alters about therapy and the person’s safety.
Uncovering the cues to flashbacks will give clues to the meaning of the traumatic experience
and will also give the person a greater sense of control over his or her symptoms.
Dealing with the traumatic memories
This part of therapy will not be dealt with by the general practitioner. The aim is not merely
to re-experience the event but rather to reprocess the event and its meaning so that the person
gains a sense of control over it. The event is often linked to a number of painful affects: guilt,
shame, grief, rage, helplessness and fear. The person needs to address the personal meaning of
the event.
Reintegration and resolution
The aim is for the (woman) to be able to accept the traumatic experience and to incorporate
it into her life-story. The experience may challenge her meaning structure, her perception and
view of herself and the world. With the re-integration of the dissociated material into conscious
memory, the aim is for her to be freed to re-enter into life with the energy to make new
relationships and to return to work and other fulfilling activities.
206
Medication
No drugs have been shown to be specifically effective in the treatment of dissociative disorders.
However, co-morbid conditions often require the appropriate drug treatment.
Transference and countertransference
At any time in therapy, the person who has been traumatised may experience a variety of
transference phenomena associated with the original trauma. He or she may identify with the
affect or behaviour of any of the participants in it. The therapist will also experience a number
of characteristic countertransference responses. Gabbard has drawn attention to four of these:
the victim, the abuser, the rescuer and the uninvolved mother1 (see Box 21-3). You need to set
limits on your availability, and the frequency and length of therapy. A failure to adhere to these
limits may only lead to exhaustion, and even to boundary violations. Moreover, making oneself
constantly available only reinforces the person’s belief that he or she is helpless. In the worst case,
it may lead to a repetition of the person’s past abuse.
The false memory debate
There is clear evidence that childhood sexual abuse, like other forms of abuse and trauma, can have
a wide range of effects on psychological functioning, including amnesia. The memories of the
event may be recalled at some later date through various forms of re-experiencing (nightmares,
flashbacks and re-enactments) and begin to be accessible to consciousness. Memory is processed
in a number of steps: encoding, storage, retrieval and presentation. The memory of an event
can be influenced at any of these stages. Memories can be altered by suggestion at the stage of
retrieval. Without collateral evidence, it is often impossible to know whether an event actually
took place. It is therefore wise to adopt a neutral stance, avoiding on one hand, disbelief of what
Box 21-3: Transference and countertransference
•	A young woman who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of her older brother discloses the abuse
during therapy. Her general practitioner is both shocked by the description of events and fascinated
by her presentation of different alters. He feels a strong desire to rescue her. He has an impulse to
care for her as if she is his child.
Comment: The general practitioner should recognise the countertransference wish to rescue. The
belief that she will get better simply by caring and loving her is unfounded. He should refer her to
a specialist in the treatment of dissociative disorders.
•	Bent on alleviating her suffering at all costs, he is unable to set limits on session times. He begins
seeing her more frequently, and consultations sometimes extend for over an hour. He begins seeing
her in the last appointment slot each day. The appointments run past the time that the reception
staff finish work, leaving him alone in the rooms with her. She begins ringing him at home,
sometimes in the middle of the night. Any evidence of fatigue or exasperation with her demands
is met by accusations that he does not care for her. She requires constant help for recurrent suicidal
thoughts. One day, he receives a call from a medical resident at the local hospital informing him that
she has taken an overdose. She states that the precipitant was the GP’s unavailability.
Comment: In his efforts to rescue her, the GP is inadvertently making things worse. His inability
to be the perfect therapist leads to an emergence of the abuser in the transference—the general
practitioner begins to feel like the victim and he experiences the patient as an abuser.
•	The therapist finds himself getting bored and fighting to stay awake as she continues to describe her
difficulties.
Comment: In the countertransference, he may be feeling like her uninvolved mother. He should
reflect on this and recognise the possible repetition of an important aspect of the original trauma.

the person tells you and, on the other, avoiding suggestion about what might have happened. Be
forthright with the person about your uncertainty and avoid being coerced into taking a stand
one way or the other. Instead, focus on the person’s current suffering and disability, and work
towards lessening his or her distress and improving his or her level of functioning.
In dealing with memories uncovered in therapy, it is wise to adopt a neutral
stance, avoiding on one hand, disbelief of what the person tells you, and on the
other, avoiding suggestion about what might have happened.

Psychotic disorders
For people suffering their first psychotic episode, there is an average delay of one year between
the development of symptoms and treatment of their condition. Seventy-five per cent of these
people will have contacted their general practitioner during this period, but failed to gain access
to care. Unfortunately, the longer the delay in treatment, the worse the person’s prognosis, a
consequence not only of a deterioration in psychosocial functioning, but also of neurobiological
changes. Just as prolonged coma and lengthy periods of post-traumatic amnesia are associated
with poorer clinical outcomes, prolonged psychosis also appears to be ‘bad’ for the brain.
There is an average delay of one year between the development of psychotic
symptoms and the commencement of treatment.
Background
Psychoses
The psychoses are conditions in which there is a loss of contact with reality. A person may develop
false ideas about reality (delusions), experience false perceptions of reality (hallucinations) or suffer
formal thought disorder (tangentiality, loose association, incoherence). Psychotic symptoms may
occur as a consequence of a medical condition. In particular, the delirious patient may suffer
any kind of psychotic symptom. Medical conditions are at the top of the diagnostic hierarchy
and must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a functional psychosis. The principal
functional psychoses are schizophrenia and bipolar mood disorder.
Medical conditions are at the top of the diagnostic hierarchy and must be
excluded before diagnosing a functional psychosis.
The division of the functional psychoses into these two broad divisions reflects the influence of
the German psychiatrist, Emil Kraepelin who, in the fifth edition of his textbook, published in
1896, made a distinction between two major syndromes, which he labelled dementia praecox
(i.e. schizophrenia) and manic-depressive insanity (i.e. bipolar mood disorder). He made this
distinction not only on the basis of characteristic symptoms and signs, but also on assumptions
about their natural histories. Dementia praecox, as the term implies, was thought to be a chronic
illness with a deteriorating course, while manic-depression was thought to be episodic with full
recovery between exacerbations.
This classification has been very influential and remains the basis of the DSM-IV and ICD 10
systems. However, it has recently come under challenge. People may present with features of both
conditions. Rates of misdiagnosis of around 30 per cent have been reported. The same person
may present with symptoms of schizophrenia on one occasion and bipolar mood disorder on
another. Between 25 and 40 per cent of people presenting with schizophrenia recover and have
no further psychotic episode, while some people with bipolar mood disorder suffer a chronic
illness with severe disability and handicap and, in some cases, the development of negative
symptoms. As a consequence, people presenting for the first time with psychotic symptoms are
often diagnosed as suffering a psychotic illness rather than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder1
.

Journal of Psychiatry 1995; 29:555-558.
210
Functional psychotic disorders do not always fit neatly into the categories of
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Epidemiology
The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is around one per cent. The first episode usually occurs
in late teens, or early to mid-twenties. On average, females develop the illness a few years later
than males. Bipolar disorder affects around 1.2 per cent of the population. The commonest age
of onset is in the third decade, but it can occur at any age.
Aetiology
Schizophrenia appears to be caused by abnormalities in the development of the brain that
become manifest in late adolescence or the early twenties, a time when the differentiation
and maturation of the central nervous system is at its most complex. In many, but not all
cases, the neurodevelopmental abnormalities are genetically determined. However, the pattern
of inheritance does not conform to classical Mendelian genetics. Instead, multiple genes, each
producing only a small effect on its own, combine to increase vulnerability. The risk of a person
developing schizophrenia if one parent has the disorder is around 12 per cent (i.e. about ten
times the risk in the general population). If both parents suffer from schizophrenia, the risk is
around 40 per cent.
Neurodevelopmental models of schizophrenia propose that genetic and non-genetic factors
cause subtle alterations to the organisation of the brain in utero. Complications of pregnancy and
childbirth may put the affected infant at increased risk of developing schizophrenia as an adult.
Prenatal exposure to viruses has also been examined; however, the research is inconclusive.
Genetic factors are also implicated in the cause of bipolar disorder. The risk of developing
an affective disorder is around 30 per cent if one parent suffers an affective disorder (bipolar
disorder, major depression or schizo-affective disorder) and 50–75 per cent if both parents suffer
an affective disorder. Mood disorders are associated with dysregulation in a number of biogenic
amine systems, including norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. Abnormalities have also
been observed in neuro-endocrine regulation, sleep architecture, circadian rhythms, and cerebral
metabolism and blood flow.
Doctors are often asked whether drugs such as marijuana or amphetamines cause schizophrenia.
There is presently no conclusive evidence to support this proposition. However, marijuana and
other psychoactive substances may precipitate an acute episode in someone with a predisposition
to psychosis. Continued use will hasten relapse and worsen the prognosis.
Although the use of psychoactive drugs such as marijuana and amphetamines
may precipitate acute episodes of psychosis and worsen prognosis, there is
presently no conclusive evidence that these substances cause schizophrenia.
Natural history and prognosis
There is a critical period of between two and five years after the first episode of schizophrenia
when most of the impairment, disability and handicap arise. Therefore, active intervention is
desirable during this stage of the illness. Recent studies suggest that the prognosis for schizophrenia
is not as poor as previously thought. Between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of people who suffer a
psychotic episode recover and never have another episode. Indicators of good prognosis include
a rapid rate of onset, rapid recovery from the first episode, the presence of affective symptoms,
stable pre-morbid personality, absence of blunted affect, presence of perplexity and confusion
during the acute episode, later age of onset, early treatment, strong family support, and the
absence of co-morbid problems such as substance abuse.
Psychotic disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 211
Active intervention is desirable in the first two to five years after the onset
of schizophrenia, the period when most of the impairment, disability and
handicap arise.
Prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms proper, people with schizophrenia often suffer a
number of prodromal symptoms. The prodrome lasts, on average, around two years. Although
these symptoms are non-specific, bear in mind the possibility that they may herald the onset
of schizophrenia. Have a high index of suspicion if there is a family history of psychosis or if
there has been a recent marked deterioration in the person’s level of functioning. See Table
22-1 for a discussion of prodromal symptoms and their treatment. The acute phase of the illness
is characterised by the appearance of positive psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations
and formal thought disorder), accompanied by feelings of distress. There is often an identifiable
precipitant to the first acute episode. A residual phase that includes many of the features of the
prodrome may follow resolution of the acute phase (see Table 22-1). Negative symptoms are
often a feature, including blunted or inappropriate affect (see Table 22-2). There may be high
levels of disability and handicap.
The natural history of manic episodes is typically of an abrupt onset and, if left untreated, a
duration of around six months. Depressive episodes usually have a slower onset and a longer
duration. For people with recurrent episodes, the periods of remission tend to get shorter, and
the frequency and duration of depressive episodes tend to increase.
Assessment and diagnosis
Schizophrenia
The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires at least six months of symptoms, including at least a
month of two or more of the following: delusions, hallucinations, passivity phenomena, formal
thought disorder, catatonia or negative symptoms. Some negative symptoms of schizophrenia
are listed in Table 22-2.
Table 22-1: Prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia and their management
Prodromal symptoms
• cognitive changes – poor concentration, vague or woolly thinking, suspiciousness or odd
preoccupation (e.g. sudden interest in a fringe religious group)
• mood changes – an anxious feeling that something in oneself or the world has changed. This
experience, sometimes referred to as delusional mood, may be relieved at the moment when the
person first develops a delusional explanation for what is happening (a primary delusion).
• behavioural changes – interpersonal withdrawal, loss of old friends, loss of interest in social activities,
problems at work or in a course of study, deterioration in self-care, drug taking (sometimes in an
attempt to self-medicate) and estrangement from family
• premorbid personality – People with schizotypal personality traits are at higher risk of developing
a psychotic illness (see Chapter 23).
Management of the prodrome
• Consider the possibility that the above symptoms may be a prodrome to the development of
psychosis and monitor for the development of psychotic symptoms.
• Use counselling and structured problem solving to deal with problems as they arise.
• Refer to appropriate agencies, e.g. to a drug and alcohol service for the treatment of substance
abuse.
• Family education and support – It will often be a family member rather than the patient who first
recognises the onset of psychotic symptoms.
212
Positive symptoms include the following:
1. delusions – false beliefs, foreign to the person’s culture, which cannot be shaken by logical
argument. The content may be persecutory, grandiose or pseudoscientific. The content of a
paranoid delusion refers to the patient him or herself. It may be grandiose or persecutory.
Delusions proper are non-understandable (e.g. the traffic light turned green and he knew
that he was the Messiah), while secondary delusions are understandable (e.g. for some years
he had been convinced that his wife was having an affair. His belief was again confirmed
when he found cigarette butts in the garden and a footprint on the lawn).
2. passivity phenomena – People with schizophrenia experience thought broadcast. They believe
that their thoughts are accessible to others (for example, while visiting the local supermarket,
a woman is mortified when she hears rude thoughts she has about her husband being
broadcast throughout the building). They may experience thought insertion, believing
that thoughts are put into their heads from outside; or thought withdrawal, that their own
thoughts are taken away (for example, a woman believes that Hollywood stars are using her
thoughts and feelings to portray characters in movies).
3. hallucinations – People with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations in any of the
sensory modalities (auditory, visual, kinaesthetic, olfactory, gustatory). However, auditory
hallucinations are the most common. They may hear voices that repeat their thoughts or
provide a running commentary on their actions. There may be two or more voices discussing
the person. The presence of hallucinations in other sensory modalities raises the possibility
of an organic cause.
4. formal thought disorder – The individual jumps from topic to topic and does not take into
account the needs of the listener. It can vary in degree from woolliness to incoherence.
Other terms used to describe the disorder include tangentiality, looseness of association and
‘knight’s move’ thinking.
5. catatonia – This is defined as an increase in muscle tone at rest, which is abolished by voluntary
movement. It includes mutism, stereotypy (maintaining a bizarre posture) and mannerism
(odd, stilted ways of performing voluntary acts). Associated features include anhedonia,
disrupted sleep patterns (e.g. sleeping during the day and staying up through the night), poor
concentration, and impaired insight and judgement. Schizophrenia presents in a number of
patterns. Disorganised schizophrenia is characterised by disorganised speech and behaviour,
and flat or inappropriate affect. In paranoid schizophrenia, there are paranoid delusions
and/or prominent hallucinations, but an absence of formal thought disorder and affective
changes. A separate category exists for catatonic schizophrenia. People with undifferentiated
schizophrenia have features that fit none of the above categories.
Table 22-2: Negative symptoms of schizophrenia
•	abnormalities of affect – Blunted affect is characterised by a decrease in the intensity of emotional
expression. The affect may be inappropriate. Anhedonia may be a feature.
•	 poverty of speech – reduced spontaneous speech
•	 poverty of content of speech – speech that conveys little information
•	reduced motivation – The person may be inactive for long periods of time and have no interest in
work or social activities.
•	social withdrawal – People may spend long periods of time in their rooms, avoiding social
interaction.
Psychotic disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 213
Bipolar disorder
The diagnosis of bipolar disorder requires the occurrence of at least one manic episode, the
characteristic feature of which is an abnormally elevated or irritable mood and labile affect for
at least a week. Other features include a decreased need for sleep, inflated self-esteem, increased
energy, pressure of speech, flight of ideas, distractibility, poor judgment (i.e. doing things at
work or at school, or involvement in pleasurable activities, without regard for possible negative
consequences). Flight of ideas is characterised by an increased flow of thought with a loss of goal.
In contrast to the formal thought disorder of schizophrenia, the logical connections between
thoughts are maintained in flight of ideas. The manic patient may suffer delusions that reflect the
mood (e.g. grandiose or persecutory) or that are incongruent with the mood (e.g. delusions of
reference). People with bipolar disorder are prone to suffering major depressive as well as manic
episodes. As a consequence of their impaired judgement and disinhibited behaviour during
manic episodes, people with bipolar disorder are at risk of suffering damage to their reputations,
financial losses and legal problems. They tend to lose insight early in the course of the illness and
so usually require hospitalisation, often against their will. Manic episodes range in severity from
hypomania, in which the person does not suffer any marked disruption of social or occupational
functioning, to mania with or without psychotic features. During some episodes, there may be
a mixture of both manic and depressive features.
Psychotic depression
The features of major depression were discussed in Chapter 14. They include persistently
depressed mood, anhedonia, neurovegetative function disturbance, psychomotor retardation
or agitation, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, poor concentration, helplessness, hopelessness,
recurrent thoughts of death and suicidality. In psychotic depression, delusions may be congruent
with the mood (e.g. nihilistic, hypochondriacal, paranoid or delusions of poverty) or mood
incongruent (e.g. religious delusions). Hallucinations, especially auditory, may also be a feature.
Delusional disorder
Delusional disorder is characterised by non-bizarre delusions occurring in the absence of other
symptoms of schizophrenia. The delusions may be jealous (e.g. a man is convinced that his
wife is being unfaithful), persecutory (e.g. an elderly woman believes that her neighbours are
spying on her), erotomanic (e.g. a woman believes that the bishop in her church is in love
with her) or somatic (e.g. a young man is convinced that he is infested with worms and keeps
taking courses of medication). Delusional disorder is distinguished from schizophrenia by an
absence of the following: prominent auditory or visual hallucinations, passivity experiences,
formal thought disorder, catatonia or prominent negative symptoms. There may be kinaesthetic
or olfactory hallucinations that are related to the delusional theme. The onset is often later
than for schizophrenia, with most beginning in middle to later life. Deafness, social dislocation
(e.g. immigration) and a sensitive pre-morbid personality are thought to predispose to the
development of the disorder. See case example in Box 22-1.
Box 22-1: A woman with delusional disorder (persecutory type)
A 75-year-old woman is brought to see you by her daughter. Over the past year, she has become
increasingly suspicious of her neighbours, whom she accuses of watching and listening to her when
she is in the bathroom, and of trying to poison her. She has blockaded the windows on one side of
her house. The neighbours called her daughter after she cut up their hose, accusing them of trying to
poison her.
She has been living alone since her husband died four years ago. Her only daughter lives interstate. She
wears a hearing aid. Her daughter describes her as always having been an orderly, rather anxious person
who would avoid social engagements unless accompanied by her husband.
214
Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of the functional psychoses includes substance abuse and physical
disorders (see Table 22-3). The delirious patient may suffer any of the psychotic symptoms
mentioned above—note the presence of an altered level of consciousness, disorientation,
poor concentration and attention, and memory disturbance. People with dementia may suffer
delusions, often persecutory, e.g. on themes that their belongings have been stolen. Epilepsy
and cerebral lesions can produce psychotic symptoms. It is particularly important to consider a
medical condition as the cause of psychosis in people over the age of 40 who present for the first
time with psychotic symptoms. Some useful investigations are listed in Table 22-4.
The victims of childhood abuse may suffer a variety of psychotic symptoms in the context of a
dissociative disorder (see Chapter 22). Schizoid, schizotypal and paranoid personality disorders
can precede the onset of schizophrenia and share some symptoms (paranoid ideation, woolly
speech, interpersonal withdrawal, odd beliefs and magical thinking).
Table 22-3: Physical disorders and substances that can cause psychotic
symptoms

• substance abuse – intoxication with alcohol, amphetamine, hallucinogens, belladonna
alkaloids, cannabis, cocaine, MDTA (ecstacy) or solvents; withdrawal from alcohol and
sedatives
• delerium of any cause
•	 dementia
•	 epilepsy
•	 neoplasm, CVA, trauma – especially involving frontal, temporal and limbic areas

Treatment
Risk assessment
The first step is to ensure the safety of the patient and of others. Refer to Chapter 3 for a detailed
discussion of the assessment of suicidality and dangerousness. People with command hallucinations
(to self-harm or to harm others) and ideas of retaliation in response to persecutory delusions are
at particular risk. Individuals may be unable to care for themselves or their dependents during
acute psychotic episodes.
The treatment setting
People with schizophrenia usually require admission during their first psychotic episode.
However, with adequate social supports, subsequent admissions are usually brief or may be
avoided altogether. Community mental health teams with an extended hours capacity facilitate
care in the community. If the person presents a danger to himself or herself, or others, involuntary
hospitalisation may be required under the provisions of the State Mental Health Act.
Hospitalisation is usually necessary during manic episodes. People may place themselves at risk
through reckless behaviour, substance abuse or unsafe sex. They may cause themselves serious
financial harm through extravagant spending or poorly judged business dealings. They may
cause damage to their reputations through disinhibited, sexually promiscuous, aggressive or
other ill-judged behaviours. People with severe depression may require hospitalisation if they
are at risk of harming themselves or others, unable to care for themselves, socially isolated, suffer
psychotic symptoms or require ECT.
Medication
Schizophrenia
Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay in the treatment of acute schizophrenia and in relapse
prevention. Over the past few years three new antipsychotics have become available: clozapine,
risperidone and olanzapine (see Table 13-1). All have a lower propensity to cause acute extrapyramidal side effects than traditional antipsychotics and are associated with fewer negative
symptoms. They may also be less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia. Clozapine is effective in
cases that are resistant to treatment with traditional antipsychotics. However, it is only available
through registered centres and requires close monitoring because of the risk of agranulocytosis.
Parenteral preparations are useful in the treatment of people who fail to adhere to oral medication.
Some practical prescribing points follow.
Table 22-4: Investigations for psychosis1
•	EEG – if temporal lobe epilepsy is suspected
•	CT scan or MRI – if structural lesions are suspected (e.g. in those with atypical presentations,
such as a late age of onset)
•	thyroid function tests
•	syphilis screen
•	HIV screen
•	B12 and folate
•	 haematological screen
•	 electrolyte screen
•	 urine/blood drug screen

The newer antipsychotics have fewer extra-pyramidal side effects than
traditional antipsychotics and are associated with fewer negative symptoms.
Clozapine has been shown to be effective in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
•	 When starting medications use low doses, gradually increasing to the standard prescribing
range (‘start low—go slow’). The very young, older and first episode patients may only require
small doses to control symptoms.
• Higher doses do not produce quicker or better outcomes, only more side effects. In general,
doses above 15mg equivalent of haloperidol have no greater antipsychotic effect.
Doses above 15mg equivalent of haloperidol have no greater antipsychotic
effect, only more side effects.
•	 Agitation can settle within hours to days. However, the positive symptoms generally take
between two and eight weeks to settle. Do not increase the dose every few days. Instead, be
patient and wait for the drug to have its effect.
While agitation can settle within hours to days, the positive symptoms
generally take between two and eight weeks to be alleviated.
•	 If sedation is required for agitated or aggressive patients, consider the addition of diazepam.
•	 Anticholinergic agents are used to prevent acute dystonic reactions when commencing or
changing the dose of antipsychotics, especially the high potency traditional drugs such as
haloperidol. Once a steady dose is attained, the anticholinergic can usually be withdrawn.
Anticholinergics can usually be withdrawn once a steady dose of the
antipsychotic has been attained.
•	 In order to minimise the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia, maintenance medication needs
to be continuous and at the lowest effective dose. Intermittent therapies, or ‘drug holidays,’ are
not recommended.
•	 For those who have had one acute psychotic episode, and who are symptom free on
medication, guidelines suggest that a medication-free trial can be considered after one or two
years of treatment. For those who have had two or more acute episodes, treatment should be
continued for at least five years. Some people will require indefinite treatment.
•	 When changing antipsychotic medications, inform patients and their carers about the risks
and benefits of the new medication and the importance of monitoring for early signs of
relapse. A crossover phase is usually recommended. Reduce the dose of the first medication
(or cease depot preparations) and gradually increase the dose of the second medication over
several weeks. When changing from a traditional antipsychotic to risperidone, a crossover
phase is required to avoid a cholinergic rebound syndrome.
•	 People on long-term therapy with traditional antipsychotics should be assessed at least once a
year for tardive dyskinesia using the AIMS of similar screening instrument (see Appendix 10).
It is important to remember that traditional antipsychotics may suppress the signs of tardive
dyskinesia, while at the same time causing it. The signs may first become apparent when the
dose is reduced.
ECT is used in the treatment of catatonic schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, people with
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and in those who cannot take or are poorly responsive to
antipsychotic medication.
Psychotic disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 217
Mania
Mood stabilisers (lithium, valproate and carbamazepine) and antipsychotics are used in the
treatment of acute episodes of mania. Mood stabilisers are prescribed for relapse prevention (see
Chapter 13 for a discussion of the use of these drugs). Contraindications to the use of lithium
include pregnancy, renal failure and recent myocardial infarction. Common reasons for nonadherence to lithium include side effects (weight gain, poor concentration, tremor, stomach
upset, urinary frequency), the burden of having to take medication over the long term, a feeling
that one’s creativity has been lost, and a wish to maintain the elevated mood of hypomania.
The decision whether or not to embark on maintenance treatment depends on the number,
severity and frequency of previous episodes; the ability of the person to recognise early signs of
relapse; the presence of suicidality or dangerousness during acute episodes; and the strength of
social supports. It is wise to involve the person’s family and other carers in the decision. Following
a first episode of mania, it is generally recommended that mood stabilisers be continued for a
minimum of six months to prevent early relapse. It is essential to inform patients and their carers
about the early signs of lithium toxicity and the circumstances under which it can occur (e.g.
dehydration as a result of gastroenteritis or other cause). Women of childbearing age must be
warned of the potential teratogenic effects of lithium.
ECT is occasionally used in the treatment of severe mania and in people with a poor response
to medication.
Depression
The treatment of depression is covered in detail in Chapter 14. The most effective treatment
for psychotic depression is ECT, though a combination of antidepressants and antipsychotics is
sometimes used. Lithium must be ceased during ECT administration.
Treatment adherence
Non-adherence to prescribed antipsychotic medication is common with a reported incidence
of between 11 and 80 per cent.1
 Some reasons for non-adherence are listed in Table 22-5.
The promotion of a strong therapeutic alliance will enhance adherence. Involve the patient in
decision-making. Explain the reasons for your recommendations rather than trying to direct the
patient to comply. Educate the patient and his or her family about the illness and the need for
medication. In particular, explain possible side effects of the medication. Enlist others in helping
a disorganised patient to monitor (his) medication. Dosette boxes may be useful for patients on
a large number of medications. Listen to why the patient refuses to adhere and empathise with
Table 22-5: Reasons for non-adherence to antipsychotic medication
•	 unpleasant side effects or a fear of developing tardive dyskinesia
•	 psychotic disorganisation
•	 misunderstandings about the need for medication
•	 denial of the illness
•	 delusional beliefs about the treatment (e.g. the belief that he or she is being poisoned)
•	 an expression of autonomy
•	 a belief that taking medication is a sign of moral weakness and a wish to try to beat the illness on
one’s own
•	 a wish to retain ego-syntonic grandiose delusions
•	 an expression of difficulties with authority acted out in the transference.

how (he) feels, but state clearly your own view and try to come to some compromise. Consider
the use of depot medication.
Behavioural treatment of psychotic symptoms
For many patients, medication provides only partial relief from the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia, while the negative symptoms are often poorly responsive to medication.
Behavioural strategies can be used to enhance symptom control.
Listening to music may help deal with auditory hallucinations. By using a Walkman, the person
can move around, and also avoid disturbing others. Other techniques include distraction by
watching television or playing a musical instrument; involvement in some activity (e.g. going to
the gym, using exercise apparatus or going for a walk); talking to others face-to-face or over the
phone; humming; or practicing relaxation exercises.
Delusions can sometimes be challenged by examining evidence for and against patients’ beliefs.
This is generally most effective when done in collaboration with the patient rather than by
confrontation. It needs to be approached with care when patients are distressed and with those
who have severe formal thought disorder.
It is also useful to identify responses that exacerbate the problems—alcohol and marijuana use,
isolation and withdrawal, or shouting at voices to ‘Go away’.
People with negative symptoms will be encouraged to be more active if family members or
carers reward desired behaviours. Similarly, the frequency of disturbing behaviour may be
reduced by rewarding the absence of these behaviours or by withdrawing reinforcement when
the disturbed behaviour occurs. Patients and carers should be asked to identify precipitants to
unwanted behaviours. These may then be modified to reduce the frequency of the behaviours.
Daily activity schedules can be used to monitor and plan increased activity levels.
Relapse prevention
Some common early signs of relapse in schizophrenia include sleep disturbance, social withdrawal,
depression, anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, deterioration in work performance, worsening
of positive symptoms (voices, delusions or formal thought disorder) and suspiciousness. It is
important to ask the patient and his or her carers to reflect on the early symptoms of his or her
last episode, and so clarify that individual’s relapse signature. They need a clear plan of action
should these symptoms recur. The treatment of early relapse involves increasing contact with the
person and his or her carers, medication review, and dealing with the precipitants of the relapse,
including substance abuse, non-adherence to medication, and life stressors.
The onset of manic episodes is often abrupt, occurring over a period of hours to days. Common
early signs include a decreased need for sleep, increased activity levels, elevated or irritable mood,
and grandiose or otherwise unrealistic plans. Since people commonly lose insight early in the
course of the illness, it is vital to involve the family and other social supports in recognising
the individual’s relapse signature and seeking early treatment. Common precipitants to manic
episodes include stressful life events, substance abuse, the use of antidepressant drugs, the cessation
of lithium, and disruption of the sleep-wake cycle. Women with bipolar disorder are at risk of
developing postnatal depression or mania. Those who recommence mood stabilisers during the
postnatal period are advised not to breast-feed.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation is the most time-consuming component of the treatment of prolonged illness. The
aims of rehabilitation are to improve patients’ ability to survive independently in the community,
to improve their social and family functioning, to maximise their educational and vocational
potential, and to optimise their involvement in leisure and recreational pursuits. In assessing a
person’s rehabilitation needs, it is important to consider the individual’s strengths, as well as his
Psychotic disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 219
or her weaknesses. A rehabilitation plan will only be effective if the person is committed to its
goals. Unless the goals are realistic, he or she will fail and may suffer a relapse, and you will feel
frustrated. For one person a realistic goal may be a return to full-time employment; for another
the appropriate goal may be maintenance of current functioning (see also goal setting in Chapter
9). It is useful to have an up-to-date list of the rehabilitation agencies in your area.
In assessing a person’s rehabilitation needs consider both the individual’s
strengths and weaknesses.
People with psychotic illnesses may suffer deficits in social and living skills—self-care, shopping,
using public transport, budgeting, cooking, housework, diet, physical health care, communication,
problem solving and participation in leisure and social activities. These are addressed through
skills training, the principles of which include breaking tasks down into small steps, keeping
explanations clear and straightforward, repeating instructions and linking steps in a logical order.
Skills training can be delivered on a one-to-one basis or in groups. Specific forms of skills training
include goal setting (see Chapter 9), structured problem solving (see Chapter 6), communication
and social skills training1
.
Various models of occupational rehabilitation have been developed. Job support networks
provide vocational assessments, social skills training and on-site assistance in the workplace.
Clubhouse projects provide both in-house tasks, such as clerical duties and kitchen work, as well
as supported employment opportunities negotiated by the clubhouse and shared between clients.
Self-help organisations include the Schizophrenia Fellowship. The Association of Relative and
Friends of the Mentally Ill (ARAFMI) is a support group for carers.
The coordination of a rehabilitation plan is time consuming for the general practitioner.
However, several Medicare Schedule items introduced on the 1 November 1999 allow the
general practitioner to bill for time spent in care planning and case-conferencing with other
professionals involved in the person’s care. Within public mental health services, case managers
perform this coordinating role (see Chapter 1). A number of divisions of general practice across
Australia are presently working with their local mental health services on programs of shared
care. For example, the Logan Area Division of General Practice and the Logan-Beaudesert
Mental Health Service have recently completed a shared care project that involved a casemanager working together with a group of six general practitioners in the care of 20 patients
who suffer from schizophrenia. The project has now been extended to involve another 15
general practitioners and all of the case managers in the Service.
Within district mental health services, case managers coordinate patients’
rehabilitation plans.
Family involvement
As a result of the shift in the delivery of mental health services from institutions to the community,
much of the burden of care now falls on families and other carers. Having a family member
diagnosed with a psychotic illness is stressful. Family members often fear that others in the
family, especially children, will develop a similar illness. They will mourn the loss of hopes and
plans for the person. They sometimes feel ashamed because of the stigma of the illness, and guilty
that they may in some way have caused it. They may have to deal with difficult and demanding
behaviours and, at times, they may even be afraid for their own or the patient’s safety. As a
consequence, they may fear leaving the person at home alone, and be reluctant to have visitors

over to stay or to take holidays. Marriages are often put under great strain.
Use counselling, structured problem solving and grief counselling to help families cope with
these problems. Educate the family about the nature of the illness, the prognosis and treatment.
Remind them that there is no evidence that patterns of family interaction or parental care
cause schizophrenia, though family conflict, like any other stressor, can increase the likelihood
of relapse. Involve the family in relapse prevention. Have a clear plan about whom they should
contact in crisis, or when other problems arise. A good way of reconciling the person’s right to
privacy with the carers’ need for information is to see the patient and the family together. Carers’
groups such as the Association of Relatives and Friends of the Mentally Ill (ARAFMI) provide
information and support to families of the mentally ill.
Use counselling and structured problem solving to help families deal with the
stress of having a member with a psychotic illness.
Complications
Depression and suicidality
Schizophrenia is frequently complicated by depression. People with schizophrenia undergo a
process of mourning, which may develop into major depression as they assess the impact of the
illness on their life plans. The differential diagnosis includes negative symptoms of the illness,
concurrent medical problems, substance abuse and extra-pyramidal side effects of medication.
Antidepressants may be prescribed, but care must be taken as they can exacerbate psychotic
symptoms.
Suicide is the leading cause of premature death in people with schizophrenia with an estimated
lifetime incidence of between 10 and 13 per cent. High-risk periods include the first six years
after diagnosis and the period immediately following discharge from hospital. In addition to the
general risk factors discussed in Chapter 3, specific risk factors in people with schizophrenia
include young age, high IQ, high aspirations, high levels of pre-morbid achievement, chronic
debilitating course of the illness, and an awareness of the losses sustained as a consequence of the
illness. Patients may know others who have committed suicide.
Between 10 and 15 per cent of people with major depression commit suicide. People with
psychomotor retardation are at risk of suicide as their condition improves and they find the
energy to act. During manic episodes people may, as a consequence of their impaired judgement,
place themselves at risk.
Violent behaviour
People with schizophrenia are, as a group, at higher risk of committing violent acts than others
in the community. However, the assessment of risk varies widely from one individual to another
and requires the consideration of a large number of factors in addition to diagnosis (see Chapter
3). During a manic episode, sufferers may be prone to threatening or assaultive behaviour. People
who are psychotically depressed are generally more of a risk to themselves than to others, but
they may be aggressive towards those in their delusional systems. Family members can be at risk
in murder–suicide.
Anxiety
Anxiety symptoms are not uncommon in psychosis. For example, a person with persecutory
delusions may develop agoraphobia out of a fear of being attacked. After a psychotic episode, people
may suffer a loss of confidence and fear recurrence of the illness. Address these complications
through active rehabilitation, encouraging adherence to medication, and by taking other steps to
prevent relapse. The management of specific anxiety disorders is discussed in Chapter 15.
Substance abuse
The prevalence of substance abuse in people with schizophrenia has been estimated to be as high
Psychotic disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 221
as 40 per cent. Substance abuse worsens prognosis with longer and more frequent hospitalisations,
and higher rates of homelessness, depression, suicide and violence. The management of substance
abuse is described in Chapter 18. Some community mental health services offer groups for
people with dual diagnosis of psychosis and substance abuse. Patients need to be educated about
interactions with antipsychotic medications. People with bipolar disorder are prone to substance
abuse during manic episodes, and they may self-medicate with alcohol or benzodiazepines.
Physical and dental health problems
The physical health of people with psychotic illnesses is often poor. A recent study found that
ischaemic heart disease is the leading cause of excess mortality in psychiatric patients, accounting
for 16 per cent of all excess deaths, compared with 8 per cent due to suicide1
. There are high
rates of smoking, obesity, underactivity, poor diet and poor dental health. General practitioners
play an essential role in addressing these problems.
Complications of psychotic illnesses include depression, suicide, anxiety,
substance abuse, and poor medical and dental health.
Individual therapy
The cornerstone of the psychological treatment of people with chronic psychotic disorders is
supportive psychotherapy (see Chapter 8). General practitioners are able to provide continuity
of care to psychotic patients, something that is often lacking in public mental health services
because of the frequent rotation of junior medical staff. Counselling and structured problem
solving are used to deal with acute crises.
A strong therapeutic alliance improves compliance and is one of the most important determinants
of good outcome, but is often difficult to establish with people suffering psychotic disorders.
Maintain a comfortable distance—be sensitive about intruding into areas that they do not want
to discuss (though this may sometimes be necessary); negotiate the frequency and length of
consultations with them; and respect their personal space.
Educate patients about their illness and its treatment. Actively involve them in all aspects of
their care. Clarify signs of relapse for each individual and, together with their carers, develop a
clear plan of action should these appear. Be realistic about the outcome for those with chronic
symptoms. Acknowledge the limits of what you can do.
Allow the person to grieve the losses associated with having the illness. People with bipolar
disorder are often ashamed and embarrassed by their behaviour during manic episodes. All
people who suffer a psychotic episode face the stigma of having suffered a serious mental illness.
For many patients, you will be the only person with whom they can discuss their psychotic
symptoms. Accepting and trying to understand these experiences will often provide relief and
strengthen the therapeutic alliance.
Accepting and trying to understand the experiences of people with psychotic
illnesses will provide relief and strengthen the therapeutic alliance.
General practitioners commonly see people with psychotic illnesses for routine monitoring
during the stable phase. Table 22-6 summarises important aspects of care in this phase.

222
The goals are to prevent relapse; diagnose and treat complications; improve social, occupational and
leisure functioning; deal effectively with stressful events; monitor for adverse effects of medication; and
optimise family functioning.
Length and frequency of appointments
This depends on the person’s current mental state. Patients will generally be seen around once a month
for about 15 minutes, but more frequently (sometimes once a day) and for longer periods during
exacerbations of the illness or in the face of stressful life events.
Specific interventions
Supportive psychotherapy
The main elements are: holding and containment, genuineness, reassurance, positive reframing,
explanation, suggestion and advice, encouragement, monitoring countertransference (see Chapter 8).
Diagnosis and treatment of complications
In particular, consider depression, suicidality, substance abuse and anxiety disorders.
Monitor for signs of relapse
Spend time with the patient and his or her family clarifying the relapse signature for that individual
(e.g. broken sleep, withdrawal from family activities, eating alone, wearing bizarre make-up). Enlist the
support of the family in spotting early signs. Treatment will depend on the assessment of the cause,
but may involve an increase in medication, increased frequency of reviews, problem solving to deal
with intercurrent stressors, treatment of intercurrent medical problems, counselling about adherence to
medication and avoidance of substance abuse, or counselling to deal with family problems.
Counselling and structured problem solving
Use these techniques to deal with crises and other stressful life events (see Chapter 6).
Education
The family and the patient will want information about the illness, its prognosis and the treatment plan.
Education is often an ongoing process, reinforcing and clarifying what has been said before, and dealing
with new issues as they arise. Be sensitive to the patient’s need for some denial.
Treatment planning and coordination
This will be done in collaboration with other agencies involved in the person’s care. The case manager at
the local mental health service is the key figure in coordinating the person’s treatment and rehabilitation
needs. You can use the new Medicare items for remuneration of these activities.
Review of medication
Monitor side effects and efficacy. In particular, monitor every six to twelve months for any evidence
of tardive dyskinesia. For those on lithium, monitor lithium levels, renal and thyroid function. Monitor
adherence. Consider the indications for the use of atypical agents.
Monitoring and enhancing adherence to treatment, including medication
Educate the patient about the side effects of the medication and collaborate with him or her in finding
the best balance between side effects and therapeutic effects. Warn the patient about the dangers of
ceasing medication—while there may be temporary relief of side effects, there is an increased likelihood
of relapse, which may in turn mean higher doses of medication later on.
Rehabilitation
The aim is to optimise the person’s social, occupational and leisure functioning. Keep in touch with the
person’s case manager. Always ask the person what he or she has been doing since the last appointment—
has he or she been out, and how are things at home.
Family involvement
Ask to see the family regularly. Educate them about the illness and the treatment plan. Use counselling
and structured problem solving to deal with acute stressors. Monitor the burden of care and the impact
of the illness on individual family members and on the family system. Refer to appropriate support
agencies.
Monitor physical health
Perform the same screening tests used for other patients.
Psychotic disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 223
Personality disorders
Personality disorders are persistent maladaptive patterns of behaviour and of perceiving and
thinking about oneself and the environment, present since adolescence, that deviate markedly
from a person’s cultural expectations. They cause significant distress to that person and to others
with whom she or he comes in contact. The DSM-IV describes ten disorders, which fall into
three groups1
:
•	 Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders. People with
these disorders appear odd or eccentric.
•	 Cluster B includes borderline, narcissistic, antisocial and histrionic personality disorders.
People with these disorders appear dramatic, emotional and erratic.
•	 Cluster C includes obsessive–compulsive, avoidant and dependent personality disorders.
Individuals with these disorders often appear anxious, constricted and fearful.
These diagnoses are purely descriptive and often an individual does not fit neatly into any one
of them. Moreover, making a diagnosis does not eliminate the need to understand a person in
terms of his or her history, current mental state and level of functioning. See Chapter 12 for a
discussion of the psychodynamic assessment of personality.
The behaviours that constitute the personality disorders are not in themselves maladaptive.
Their value can only be judged by their impact on the individual and others in the contexts
in which they occur. All people have dependency needs—they underlie our social behaviour
and our attachments to others. Conscientiousness and perfectionism are frequently adaptive,
especially when the consequences of careless behaviour are serious. Bold ambition and dreams
of ideal love and beauty can be realised in works of art and other creative productions. A vigilant
and suspicious mind may be valuable in uncovering corruption. Everybody lies, and nobody is
perfect. Life would be dull if everyone obeyed the rules all of the time. As health professionals, it
is not our primary role to make moral judgements about the people whom we treat.
The behaviours that constitute the personality disorders can only be judged as
maladaptive in the contexts in which they occur.
These disorders are, by definition, long-standing ways of behaving and change only slowly.
However, certain maladaptive traits may become attenuated over time, with or without
treatment—for example, the aggressiveness of the sociopath. Unfortunately, however, some
people remain difficult into old age.
General practitioners need to be aware of the common complications of the personality
disorders, and to be able to diagnose and treat them. They include depression, anxiety and
substance abuse. People with personality disorders are difficult to treat. Many of those whom
TC O’Dowd dubbed ‘heartsink patients’ fall into this category2
. The general practitioner needs
to understand common countertransference reactions to these people. By being conscious of
these, you will be less likely to act out upon them. Your communication with them will be
enhanced, as will your ability to treat their intercurrent mental and physical problems. You will

224
avoid some of the distressing personal reactions that can complicate their treatment. Moreover,
your countertransference responses will provide valuable information about the person.
The lives of people with personality disorders are often stressful and chaotic. In part, this is
because rather than confront and deal with their problems, they tend to use denial, dissociation,
acting out and other maladaptive defences to cope. Persuading these people to articulate and
clarify their problems in often difficult. Nevertheless, the general practitioner should persist
in helping the person to do so, and to use structured problem solving in dealing with them
(see Chapter 6). Detailed discussion of past events, including past abuse, is generally best left
to the person’s therapist. Structured problem solving approaches may be supplemented by the
behavioural and cognitive behavioural techniques described in Chapters 9 and 10. For people
with severe personality disorders, supportive psychotherapy is used (see Chapter 8).
We are at greatest risk of acting out when patients arouse impulses and
feelings in us that we habitually defend against.
In the following sections, I first describe the features of the disorders and some of their common
psychiatric complications. I then describe the types of transference and countertransference
reactions that commonly arise when dealing with these people, and how an understanding of
these can inform treatment.
Cluster A
Paranoid personality disorder
Paranoid people have a pervasive suspiciousness and mistrust of others. They suspect the motives
of others and are often preoccupied about whether or not friends and colleagues can be trusted.
They may suspect the fidelity of their spouses. They are guarded and tend to read hidden and
threatening meanings into everyday events. They bear grudges and are sensitive to anything that
they perceive as a criticism.
Paranoid people may go on to develop delusional disorder or schizophrenia. Their estrangement
from others places them at increased risk of depression. Their fears of others can lead to
agoraphobia. They may abuse alcohol or other substances in an attempt to settle their persistent
anxiety and arousal.
In the countertransference they evoke defensiveness. The interaction between you and the
patient can sometimes be understood as the patient projecting their malevolent image of others
onto you. First, recognise the angry feelings that you experience. Second, try to contain these
feelings and not act defensively upon them. Acting out upon them may only confirm the
patient’s paranoid perception of you.
Be open and straightforward. If, for example, a man is suspicious about the notes you are taking,
let him read them. If he criticises you for being late, apologise. Rather than dispute his perception
of events, ask for more detail and empathise with how he must feel, given his paranoid beliefs.
To do this, imagine how you would feel if you held similar beliefs. Do not press too hard for
information from guarded patients, but rather empathise with the tension that they experience
in having to be so vigilant. Do not be over-friendly, but rather maintain a professional distance.
Encourage them to talk about their anger as an alternative to acting it out. Carefully monitor
your countertransference. It is very easy to make a sarcastic remark or some other hurtful
comment, which will only inflame the situation.
In dealing with a paranoid person, be open, straightforward and serious.
Maintain a professional distance and do not press too hard for information.
Personality disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 225
In some cases, it may be possible to begin to challenge a man’s misconceptions by, for example,
asking him about the presence of certain crucial evidence for his beliefs. If he says that his
neighbour hates him, you might ask if the neighbour has actually said so. If not, you can calmly
point out the uncertainty of his judgement.
Schizoid/schizotypal personality disorder
Schizoid people tend to be detached from others and display only a limited range of emotions.
They have no desire for close relationships and prefer solitary activities. They are often seen as
being cold and distant. Schizotypal patients are similarly detached from social relationships, but
they also exhibit odd and eccentric behaviours. They may be superstitious; they may believe in
telepathy or ‘sixth sense’; and they are often circumstantial and vague in their speech.
Schizoid and schizotypal personality disorder may precede the development of delusional disorder
or schizophrenia. People with these disorders are prone to the development of depression.
Because of their coldness and emotional distance, these people may inspire countertransference
feelings of boredom, frustration or anger. The therapist may feel helpless and wish to withdraw.
Schizoid people fear closeness with others and expect to drive you away. Try to stay with them,
do not push and probe, be patient and respect the patient’s ‘silent self’. With time, they may begin
to discuss previously hidden aspects of themselves and place a high value on their relationship
with you.
With a schizoid person, tolerate the silences, do not be intrusive, and respect
the person’s ‘silent self’.
Cluster B
Borderline personality disorder
As a group, people with borderline personality disorder are amongst the most difficult to treat. The
disorder is characterised by marked instability in interpersonal relationships alternating between
the extremes of idealisation and devaluation. People with borderline personality disorder cannot
tolerate being alone, and make frantic efforts to avoid abandonment. They may repeatedly selfharm. Their identity is disturbed. They are impulsive in their behaviour, and they exhibit rapid
and intense fluctuations in affect between boredom, dysphoria, anger and anxiety.
People with borderline personality disorder are at risk of depression, substance abuse and eating
disorders. They may also be suffering the sequelae of abuse, including post-traumatic stress
disorder, dissociative disorders or somatoform disorders.
A well-validated treatment for people with borderline personality disorder is dialectical
behaviour therapy, developed by Marsha Linehan1
. This is based largely on behavioural and
cognitive behavioural techniques, but also incorporates insights from a wide range of therapies,
including psychodynamic psychotherapy. The therapy is usually delivered in two concurrent
parts—individual psychotherapy and skills training. The skills training component has been
manualised and is usually run in group sessions of two-and-a-half hours duration, once a week
over 12 months2
. This approach is presently being adopted at some sites in Australia.
General practitioners should try to focus on the immediate here and now problems and stressors
1 Linehan MM. Cognitive-Behavioural Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. New York: The Guilford
Press, 1993.

Press, 1993.
226
confronting the individual, rather than on the person’s past problems, including any past abuse.
Identifying and clarifying the precipitants to self-harming behaviour is often difficult because
of the person’s tendency to avoid problems through the use of denial, dissociation and acting
out. The precipitant to self-harming may be an unpleasant affective state, for example, a feeling
of emptiness and boredom when left alone. Use counselling and structured problem solving to
help these people find more effective solutions to their problems. The techniques of cognitive
behavioural therapy may also be useful. The techniques of supportive psychotherapy will be used
for people with severe borderline personality disorder.
General practitioners should focus on helping people with borderline
personality disorder identify, clarify and solve their current problems, rather
than dwelling at length on their past abuse.
People with borderline personality disorder arouse intense countertransference feelings. In
response to an idealised transference, you may be tempted to act out in a variety of ways. Feeling
flattered at being told that you are the only person who has ever really understood and helped
a person, you may try to live up to this image of the ‘perfect’ therapist and have fantasies of
rescuing him or her. You may regularly extend appointments beyond the agreed times. You may
begin seeing a patient out of hours and in places outside your consulting rooms. You may find
yourself accepting dinner engagements and even asking the person home. It is not unheard of for
such patients to eventually move in with their therapists and enter into a sexual relationship with
them. True to the countertransference, doctors who are drawn into these boundary violations
typically act on the belief that the only way the person’s problems could be alleviated was
through an intimate relationship with them.
A corollary of the person’s idealisation of you may be his or her devaluation of others involved
in their care. Failing to acknowledge and recognise feeling so special, you may find yourself
criticising your colleagues, accusing them of being unable to understand the person and of not
caring enough about him or her. For devalued therapists who are struggling to cope with a
hostile, self-harming patient, there is nothing harder to tolerate than the self-righteous, idealised
therapist who is critical of their best attempts at treatment.
People with borderline personality disorder may at different times idealise or
devalue their therapists.
This conflict can be understood through the concept of splitting, a defence mechanism that
has both intrapsychic and external manifestations. The intrapsychic component involves
people having polarised views of themselves and others, either all good or all bad. Instead of
recognising that people are a combination of both good and bad, such people keep good and bad
representations of themselves and of others separate and compartmentalised. In some cases, they
have been the victims of abuse and, by keeping good and bad object representations apart, they
protect the good from being destroyed by the bad. The external manifestations of splitting are
seen when conflict arises between other people in their milieu—in particular, between idealised
and devalued therapists. When splitting between therapists does occur, try to recognise it. Meet
with your colleague and listen to his or her experience of the patient. Try to reach agreement
on how the person should be treated. If possible, meet together with the patient, united in your
approach. If you treat these people, you will experience what it is like to be treated as both good
and bad. At one time you will be idealised, at another, devalued.
Idealisation and devaluation can be understood as external manifestations of
splitting. Intrapsychic splitting involves keeping good and bad representations
of the self and of others separate and compartmentalised.
Personality disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 227
It is particularly difficult to deal with the borderline patient’s self-destructive behaviour, which
may include cutting, over-dosing, burning with cigarettes, risk-taking and sexual promiscuity.
While the intention behind these behaviours may not be to commit suicide, people with
borderline personality disorder have a suicide rate of around 8 per cent. The risk of suicide in
people who self-harm has been estimated to be 140 times the population average.
The self-harming behaviour may be a maladaptive way of seeking help, a behaviour learnt
within past abusive relationships. It can also be understood as a type of acting out through which
an unbearable affect (emptiness, boredom, anxiety, helplessness) can be neutralised.
Self-harming behaviours promote strong countertransference responses. Anger is prominent—
indeed, the affect may at times be more accurately described as hate. Be careful to acknowledge
such feelings to prevent acting out. You might withdraw or make a sarcastic remark. Instead of
acting out the hate directly, you might, through reaction formation, do the opposite and make
desperate attempts to rescue the person. Rescue fantasies may arise from anxiety and guilt about
the person’s behaviour, and a feeling that you are helpless to do anything about it. There is the
danger that the extraordinary measures you take to stop him or her from self-harming may
ultimately do more harm than good. They will reinforce the person’s feelings of helplessness and
could even lead to boundary violations.
Instead of embarking on desperate attempts at rescue, set clear limits about what you can and
cannot realistically do. Be open and discuss these limits with the person. For example, acknowledge
that ultimately the safety of a young woman is in her own hands. Seek an agreement with her to
seek other more adaptive ways of dealing with her feelings by, for example, speaking to someone
about how she feels. At the same time, acknowledge her need for such behaviour; recognise that
it is a solution to a painful and distressing state of being. Use structured problem solving to find
more adaptive ways of dealing with stressors.
In response to self-harming behaviour express your concern, but acknowledge
the limits of what you can do. Try to reach a safety agreement with the person.
Focus on the here and now issues and use structured problem solving to deal
with him or her.
People with borderline personality disorder, unable to articulate why they have harmed
themselves, may sometimes present a bland, smiling affect in response to self-harming behaviour.
This response can be understood as a form of splitting in which the impulse to self-harm
has become separated from the idea and the affect with which it was associated. As children,
this was often the only way these people had of dealing with sexual abuse or other traumatic
experiences over which they had no control. Do not join in, laughing and clowning. If you
do so, you are, like the patient, probably defending against acknowledging your own fear and
despair. In general, it is advisable to maintain a serious demeanour. Do not be annoyed by the
bland affect—acknowledge the attempt to put a brave face on a frightening and distressing
experience. Try to understand and articulate the affect that the person defends against. Ask about
precipitants in order to help the person to connect the affect with the idea and the impulse. For
example, it might be useful for a young man to write down what is running through his mind
at times when he feels the need to harm himself.
In response to a bland, smiling affect, do not clown and joke or get annoyed
with the person. Remain serious and concerned.
Do not force people to describe their experiences of abuse. This may constitute a form of
abuse in itself. Instead, allow them to confront these memories when they choose. This will be
difficult and unpleasant. Monitor your countertransference responses. Acknowledge to yourself
any voyeuristic gratification that you experience to ensure you do not act out upon it by, for
228
example, probing the person for more detailed descriptions of the abuse. A paradox exhibited by
people with borderline personality disorder is that while being in a state of emotional turmoil,
they may nevertheless be unable to adequately grieve their losses. Assist them through the
mourning process (see Chapter 7).
Narcissistic personality disorder
A certain degree of narcissism (as well as dependency, suspiciousness, orderliness and denial) is
normal and adaptive. Separating pathological narcissism from healthy self-regard is not always
easy, but an important distinguishing feature is the inability of the narcissistic person to love
others. Such people use other people and then discard them. They lack regard for the feelings of
others. Their intimate relationships are impoverished. A failure of the narcissistic person to live
up to his of her high expectations can predispose to depression. These people are also at risk of
substance abuse.
People with narcissistic personality disorder are prone to depression and
substance abuse when they fail to live up to their high expectations of
themselves.
Grandiosity, an insatiable need for admiration and a lack of empathy with others characterise
the disorder. Narcissistic people are preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power,
brilliance and ideal love. They are vulnerable to feeling ashamed when they fail to live up to the
exacting standards that they set themselves. They have a sense of entitlement about receiving
favourable treatment and expect obedience to their every wish. When not envious of others,
they are convinced that others must be envious of them. Their manner is arrogant, haughty,
superior and dismissive.
In the transference they may, like those with borderline personality traits, idealise the therapist.
Therapists who are unaware of their own narcissistic needs may accept this projection and
act out upon it, for example, by encouraging the person’s devaluation of his or her previous
therapists.
Boredom is a frequent countertransference response to people with narcissistic personality
disorder who talk continuously about themselves while being quite oblivious of the therapist.
Failure to recognise and contain these feelings may lead to withdrawal from the person, or angry
retaliation at his or her selfishness.
In dealing with narcissistic people, you may feel controlled as they vigilantly observe and criticise
anything that may be construed as a lack of complete attention to themselves. At such times
it may be useful to interpret their response by saying, for example, ‘You seemed upset when I
reached for the medical record.’
You will also have to cope with the person’s devaluation. If you fail to acknowledge and contain
your feelings of hurt, you may be tempted to retaliate against him or her. This may be particularly
difficult to avoid if you fail to acknowledge your own narcissistic needs.
Antisocial personality disorder
The DSM-IV criteria for antisocial personality disorder include a history of conduct disorder
in adolescence and a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others. The
disorder is characterised by participation in unlawful activities, lying, impulsivity, aggressiveness,
a disregard for the safety of oneself and others, irresponsibility at work and at home, and a lack
of remorse.
People with antisocial personality disorder are at risk of depression and substance abuse.
Somatoform disorders may also be more prevalent in this group and among their relatives.
Personality disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 229
The antisocial person will try to corrupt you. For example, a patient of a psychiatrist who
was having difficulty selling his house, offered to burn it down so that the psychiatrist could
collect the insurance. Be careful not to laugh or otherwise show any appreciation of such a
suggestion. Such people mean what they say and clear rejection and disapproval should meet
such comments.
Confront the person’s denial and minimisation of his antisocial behaviour. For example, if he
says, ‘I sorted him out,’ ask exactly what he did and then clarify the action: ‘You mean you hit
him’.
With the antisocial person, confront the denial of his antisocial behaviour—do
not collude with the excitement he experiences hurting others—and try
to connect actions with internal affects and thoughts. Do not have high
expectations of success.
Be careful not to empathise with the patient’s sense of excitement and domination when he
describes hurting someone else. Such a response is a type of pseudo-empathy and represents
collusion with the person’s antisocial behaviour.
Like people with borderline personality disorder, antisocial people act out strong impulses as a
defence against acknowledging their affective and ideational origins—for example, their feelings
of emptiness and anxiety in response to not having what they want. Try to connect actions with
internal feeling states and carefully examine precipitants to impulsive behaviour.
Finally, accept the fact that these people are very difficult to change. Be resigned to the
fact that they probably will succeed in deceiving you at some point. In some cases, they are
probably untreatable. Do not have high expectations for success; otherwise, you are likely to be
disappointed.
Histrionic personality disorder
This disorder is characterised by patterns of excessive emotionality and attention seeking
behaviour. Such people need to be the centre of attention. They are inappropriately seductive in
their manner. Their speech is impressionistic and lacking in detail. They are suggestible and easily
influenced by others, often taking on the attitudes, characteristics and even speech inflections of
the people they are with. They tend to overrate the intimacy of their relationships. People with
the disorder are predisposed to develop depression. They may also present with somatoform
disorders.
One of the frustrations of treating histrionic people is their dramatic, yet imprecise, style of
communication. Asked to describe a symptom, a histrionic man might say, ‘It was like being
stabbed in the back with a red-hot poker’. While superficially rather colourful, such a description
provides you with little useful information. Moreover, the person with histrionic personality
disorder will resist your efforts to get a clearer description of the pain. This impressionistic
cognitive style is evidence of the principal defence mechanisms used by these people—denial and
repression. In particular, people with histrionic personality disorder find it difficult to describe
feelings. Paradoxically, their emotional and dramatic displays often defend against experiencing
deeper and more disturbing feelings. Be patient and gently challenge their resistance by trying
to clarify the exact nature of their symptoms. Remember, however, that by doing so you will
increase their anxiety.
The impressionistic style of communication of people with histrionic traits is a
manifestation of their primary defences—repression and denial.
230
As a further defence against threatening thoughts and feelings, histrionic people may try to
switch the focus of attention onto you and begin to question you about your life. Falling into
this countertransference trap, you may then find the suggestible histrionic patient taking on your
own attitudes and beliefs. It is generally unwise to self-disclose to histrionic patients.
The person with histrionic personality disorder may develop an erotic transference towards you.
A failure to monitor your own countertransference responses could lead to boundary violations.
On the other hand, an understanding of the origins and meaning of the erotic transference can
provide important insights into the patient’s neurosis.
Cluster C
Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder
This set of personality traits is different from obsessive–compulsive disorder, which is characterised
by obsessions (recurrent, unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (ritualised acts that are performed
to decrease anxiety). See Chapter 15 for a discussion of obsessive–compulsive disorder.
People with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder are preoccupied with orderliness and
doing things perfectly. They have a need to be in control. They tend to be rigid and lacking in
spontaneity. They have difficulty seeing the wood for the trees. While some of these traits are
adaptive in our society—for example, in obtaining an academic degree or in being a medical
practitioner—people with this personality disorder are at risk of depression when they fail to
meet their own exacting standards, and they become anxious and irritable when their sense of
being in control is threatened.
People with obsessive–compulsive traits have a need to be in control and are
prone to anxiety and irritability when this is threatened.
Typical countertransference reactions include boredom and irritation with the patients’
circumstantial and over-inclusive speech. In response to their controlled affect, you may feel distant
and cold towards them. You may overlook some of their problems because of the discomfort you
have in confronting your own obsessive–compulsive traits. In response to the tendency of these
people to dominate the interview, you may be drawn into a battle for control.
As with the other personality disorders, the first step in dealing with these people is to be
aware of your own countertransference responses. Try to get beyond their words to uncover
the feelings and impulses behind them. In particular, allow them to acknowledge their anger. In
patients with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, anger may be disguised by their use of
the defence of reaction formation. For example, a man’s repeated expressions of concern about
another’s well being may disguise his anger with that person.
Avoidant personality disorder
Like schizoid people, those with avoidant personalities have difficulties in social relationships.
However, unlike schizoid people who have no wish for such relationships, people with avoidant
personality disorder long for intimate relationships, but avoid them, fearing rejection, humiliation
and shame. They are prone to depression, anxiety disorders and substance abuse.
People with avoidant traits are prone to depression, anxiety and substance
abuse.
In the countertransference, you may feel bored because of the person’s silences and his or her
generally inhibited behaviour. Avoidant patients expect people to be critical of them, to humiliate
Personality disorders
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 231
them and to put them to shame. Acknowledge any such impulses so as to avoid acting out upon
them. Encourage the person to confront feared social situations. Tolerate their silences.
Dependent personality disorder
Dependency is a human trait that includes normal needs for approval, empathy and validation.
Conflicts over dependency are features of all personality disorders—the obsessional person’s
fears of dependency and its attendant loss of control; the borderline person’s fears of merger and
rejection; the avoidant person’s fear of humiliation and rejection.
People with dependent personality disorder want others to make decisions for them. They are
submissive and require constant reassurance. They cannot disagree with others for fear of a loss
of support or approval. They are highly vulnerable to the loss of close relationships and are
preoccupied with fears of such relationships ending.
Dependent people try to persuade their therapists to tell them how they should solve their
problems. Be aware of this impulse and avoid giving advice. Instead, use the techniques of
counselling and structured problem solving described in Chapter 6. Dependent people may
suffer a relapse following an improvement. They fear that if they get better, they will lose your
support. They are at risk of becoming depressed, especially after relationships break down. Their
fears of losing important relationships leave them prone to anxiety disorders.
Dependent people often fear that if they get better, they will lose your support.
All of us have conflicts over dependency. A motivation for entering a caring profession may be to
provide the care that an ideal caregiver might have given to us. Because of our own dependency
issues, we may tend to deny aspects of the countertransference when dealing with dependent
people. Be careful to monitor feelings of disdain or contempt for the person’s clinging behaviour.
On the other hand, the impulse to try to provide ‘perfect care’ may only lead to exhaustion and
disappointment.
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 233
Child and adolescent mental health
Child and adolescent mental health problems need to be understood in the context of:
a) the child’s stage of development
b) the child’s social context—family, school, peers and work.
Developmental considerations
Failures to achieve normal developmental milestones (e.g. sphincter control, speech) or regression
to an earlier developmental stage (e.g. enuresis, encopresis) are important diagnostic signs. The
developmental stage will determine the way in which problems are expressed. The developmental
stage also determines the appropriate interview and therapy techniques.
Childhood mental health problems often present with signs of regression to an
earlier developmental stage.
Adolescence is sometimes viewed as a period of ‘normal crisis’, but, in fact, most adolescents
maintain good relationships with their parents through this phase. Adolescence involves significant
maturational changes—the physiological changes of puberty; cognitive changes (in particular, the
development of abstract thinking and a more sophisticated moral sense); psychological changes
(in particular, the consolidation of the adolescent’s identity); and increased social expectations
towards increasing self-reliance and autonomy, preparation for a career, detachment from parents,
and the development of intimate relationships.
Social context
Children are dependent on adults—their parents, teachers, and others, including their general
practitioner. It is often parents or teachers who first recognise that a child has a problem. A child’s
problems are influenced by and, in some cases, are reflections of family problems or problems
at school. Treatments, especially in younger children, almost always involve the child’s parents,
family, and other authority figures such as teachers.
The treatment of childhood mental health problems requires the involvement
of parents, family members and other authority figures such as teachers.
The social world of adolescents includes the family, school, peers and work colleagues. The
developmental changes may challenge both the family and the adolescent. For example, the
parent who is dependent on a child will feel threatened when that child begins to develop
more autonomy during adolescence. The adolescent’s progress at school and the quality of his or
her peer relationships are important measures of his or her adaptation. Problems in these areas
constitute important aspects of the adolescent’s disability and handicap.
Epidemiology
Children
Around seven per cent of children suffer moderate to severe mental health problems with a
further 15 per cent having mild problems. The prevalence of conduct disorder is about four per
cent, while that of emotional disorder is about 2.5 per cent. The prevalence of mental disorders
overall is about twice as high among boys as it is amongst girls, though the prevalence of
Chapter 24
234
emotional disorders may be slightly higher in girls.
Risk factors include low IQ, brain disorder (34 per cent prevalence of concurrent mental disorder),
physical illness (10 per cent prevalence of mental disorders), discordant family relationships,
mental disorder in either parent and lack of emotional warmth displayed towards the child by
the parents.
Adolescents
The prevalence of moderate to severe mental disorders among adolescents is between 15–20 per
cent, about twice that found in childhood. The prevalence in boys peaks in early teens, while in
girls it peaks in late teens. About half of the mental disorders are conduct disorders. Most of the
rest are emotional/neurotic disorders. Psychotic disorders may present in this age group.
The prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents is about twice that in
children.
Mental disorders presenting in adolescence include both those typical of childhood (for example,
enuresis, school refusal), as well as those typical of adult populations (major depression, panic
disorder, schizophrenia and agoraphobia).
History and examination
In general, children and adolescents will be seen together with one or both of their parents and
often with their entire family (see also Chapter 5). The dynamics of the family interactions will
be evident in the family interview. The problem may in fact be with another family member or
in the family system, rather than the child who presents or is brought to see you. After the family
interview, the child should be interviewed alone. This is especially important when treating
adolescents.
In assessing a child’s mental health problems, interview the family, the child
alone and the parents.
Although the psychiatric interview follows a similar format to that of the adult interview, there
are some differences. In assessing the presenting complaint, it is important to note the context
in which the problems occur. Specifically, problems may exist at home, at school or in both
contexts. A specific learning difficulty, for example, may lead to problems at school but not at
home. A child with disturbed parents may show no evidence of problems while at school.
In assessing the level of a child’s disability and handicap, ask about relevant developmental tasks
(i.e. school performance, relationships with peers, teachers and the family, evidence of any antisocial behaviour, and involvement in extra-curricular activities). Take a developmental history of
the child (i.e. obstetric history, early milestones, school adjustment and social development).
Note important adverse events, for example serious medical procedures, hospital admissions,
separations from parents, family bereavements, or frequent changes of address or school.
Assess the personalities of the parents—their ages, occupations, work histories, relationships with
their parents, and their current marital and sexual adjustment.
The assessment of a child’s mental state is best conducted in an age-appropriate setting. For
young children, this is often best done by observing the child at play. The content of a child’s
inner world may be most eloquently expressed through his or her drawings. Useful projective
tests include asking the child to draw pictures of a person and of the family, and asking what
he or she would like if given three wishes. Assess the young person’s developmental level and
Child and adolescent mental health

language ability. Note his or her ability to separate from parents and his or her attitude to you.
Transference and countertransference reactions may be stronger and less defended than those
experienced between two adults.
Specific conditions
The following sections deal with the diagnosis and treatment of some of the common child
and youth mental disorders. I also discuss the assessment and management of child abuse, and
advice to parents on managing a child’s behaviour. See Chapter 18 for a discussion of alcohol
and substance abuse, and Chapter 22 for the treatment of psychoses.
Tic disorders
Tic disorders range in severity from transient tic disorder, through chronic motor or vocal tic
disorder, to Tourette’s disorder. Tics are rapid, repetitive, non-rhythmic movements of sudden
onset. They may involve stereotyped movements or vocalisations. Although experienced as
irresistible, they can be delayed. There are often premonitory sensations localised in the region
of the tic. The location, duration, intensity, complexity and frequency of tics may vary over time.
They tend to be exacerbated by stress, and attenuate during absorbing activities and sleep.
Simple motor tics include blinking, shrugging, grimacing and coughing. Complex motor tics
include grooming, holding odd facial expressions, squinting, tapping, hopping, stomping or
making rude gestures. Common simple vocal tics include throat clearing, grunting, sniffing,
snorting or saying ‘aaah’. Complex vocal tics include repeating words of phrases out of context
such as, ‘You bet’; repeating one’s own words or phrases; repeating others’ words, phrases or
sentences; and swearing or using obscene language (coprolalia).
Assessment and diagnosis
The disorders described in DSM-IV are distinguished from one another by their duration,
severity and the variety of tics present. Transient tic disorder is characterised by tics occurring
on most days for at least four weeks, but for no longer than a year. Chronic motor or vocal tic
disorder requires the presence of either motor or vocal tics, but not both, that occur regularly for
at least a year. For a diagnosis of Tourette’s disorder to be made, there must be both motor and
vocal tics for at least a year. All require an onset before the age of 18 years.
The diagnosis of Tourette’s disorder requires the presence of both motor and
vocal tics for at least a year with an onset before the age of 18 years.
In addition to the diagnostic assessment of the tic disorder, one should also note the presence
of any co-morbid conditions, in particular, obsessive–compulsive disorder, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, depression and anxiety disorders. Assess the levels of symptoms in different
settings, the levels of disability and handicap, the impact of the illness on family functioning and
the presence of stressors that may be exacerbating the tics.
Differential diagnosis
Descriptions of tics and other abnormal movements are given in Table 24-1. Abnormal movements
occur in a variety of physical illnesses (e.g. Huntington’s disease, post-viral encephalitis, multiple
sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, and head injury) or in association with substance use (e.g.
neuroleptics and stimulants). Tics must be differentiated from Parkinsonian side effects of
neuroleptic medications (including tardive dyskinesia).
236
Epidemiology
Transient tics occur commonly, with an estimated lifetime prevalence as high as 20 per cent.
Tourette’s disorder is rare, with a prevalence of around one per 2000. The disorders are more
common in boys than girls1
.
Familial pattern
A vulnerability to Tourette’s disorder is transmitted by autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance
with a higher penetrance in males (99 per cent) than in females (70 per cent)2
. The vulnerability
may be expressed in tic disorders of differing severity. There is an increased incidence of
obsessive–compulsive disorder in people with Tourette’s disorder.
There is an increased incidence of obsessive–compulsive disorder in people with
Tourette’s disorder.
Course and prognosis
Tourette’s disorder usually has an onset in middle childhood (average age around seven years).
The illness is usually lifelong, but with periods of remission and exacerbation. The symptoms
often lessen in severity in adolescence and adulthood. Around 40 per cent of people who have
suffered Tourette’s disorder for more than 10 years have symptoms of obsessive–compulsive
disorder.
Treatment
Education
Educate the family and the child about the nature of the illness, its prognosis, treatment and
rehabilitation. Doing so will reduce anxiety about the illness and strengthen the therapeutic
alliance.
Behavioural interventions
The tics may be associated with behavioural disturbance, which will in turn lead to further
distress, disability and handicap. Identify these problems and use the behavioural interventions
described in the section on ‘parenting advice’ to manage them. Learning difficulties may
exacerbate behaviour problems at school. These should be assessed and appropriate interventions
introduced in the classroom. Teachers and sometimes the child’s classmates may require education
about the illness.
Individual psychotherapy
A chronic condition in which a person acts involuntarily, and often in ways that offend social
mores, can lead to rejection and a lowering of self-esteem. This may in turn lead to oppositional,

tic – sudden, rapid, involuntary, purposeless, repeated movement of circumscribed groups of muscles
chorea – dancing, random, irregular, non-repetitive movements
dystonia – slow, twisting movements associated with periods of prolonged muscular tension
athetosis – slow, irregular writhing movements, usually affecting fingers, toes, face or neck muscles
myoclonus – brief, shock-like muscle contractions
hemiballismus – intermittent, large-amplitude, unilateral movements of the limbs
spasms – slow, stereotyped prolonged contractions of muscle group

risk-taking, or overly dependent behaviour. Normal developmental steps may be delayed. These
negative reactions can be dealt with in therapy using the counselling and structured problem
solving techniques described in Chapter 6.
Family therapy
Issues addressed in family therapy include the stress of the illness on other family members,
the exacerbation of pre-existing marital conflict, and the role of family stress and conflict in
exacerbating symptoms (see Chapter 5).
Treat co-morbid conditions
These include obsessive–compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression,
anxiety disorders and learning difficulties.
Pharmacological treatment
Clonidine, an alpha2-noradrenergic agonist, is used in doses up to 3 to 4 micrograms/kg/day
orally to suppress tics. Doses begin at 50 micrograms a day, increasing by 50 micrograms a week.
Doses should not exceed 300 micrograms per day1
. A trial of at least three months is required
to assess its full therapeutic effect. Side effects include sedation, dry mouth, headaches, postural
hypotension and rebound hypertension on abrupt withdrawal.
Haloperidol, in doses up to 0.075 mg/kg/day orally has been used in the suppression of symptoms
in Tourette’s disorder. The dose should begin with 0.25–0.5mg orally and be gradually increased
every one to two weeks1
. It has a more rapid onset of action than clonidine, but also more
disabling side effects, including extra-pyramidal symptoms, sedation, weight gain and endocrine
abnormalities. Particular care must be taken to screen for the development of tardive dyskinesia
(see Appendix 10).
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are used to treat co-morbid obsessive–compulsive symptoms.
The treatment of impulsivity, inattention and hyperactivity is more difficult as stimulants may
worsen the tics. We recommend referral to a child psychiatrist if clonidine and haloperidol are
ineffective or poorly tolerated.
The treatment of tic disorders involves education of the child and the family
about the condition, advice to parents on how to deal with behaviour
problems, counselling and structured problem solving to deal with stressors,
treating co-morbid condition, and the use of medication to suppress the tics.
Pervasive developmental disorders
These disorders are characterised by severe impairments in social interaction and communication
skills, and the presence of stereotyped behaviours, interests and activities. It is desirable for the
general practitioner to be confident in both making and excluding the diagnosis. As a key
person in the coordination of the different aspects of care, the general practitioner should also
be familiar with the range of treatment and rehabilitation services available.
It is desirable for the general practitioner to be confident in both making and
excluding the diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder.
In his initial description of autism in 1943, Kanner focused on how deficits in social interaction
are sometimes accompanied by areas of unexpected competence such as rote memory2
.
Unfortunately, he also hypothesised that the condition was caused by abnormal patterns of
1

238
family interaction. He later revised this theory, recognising that abnormal family interactions
were usually an effect rather than a cause of the condition.
The disorder has, from the outset, been the subject of conflicting views and controversies that are
a further source of distress for parents coming to terms with their child’s chronic and disabling
condition. Are sufferers in fact people of exceptional ability held captive by their illness? What
are parents to make of the claims of the latest fad ‘cure’ (for example, through diet, avoidance of
‘allergens’, or ‘hugging and holding’)? Does aversive conditioning have any role in treatment?
It is important for the general practitioner to be aware of empirically tested interventions and
to be sceptical of the dramatic claims of unproven and often expensive approaches to treatment.
The condition has a life-long course. It can result in profound disability and handicap for
the individual sufferer and considerable stress for family members. There is no cure. Instead,
treatment aims to minimise individual suffering and disability, to promote development, and to
support families in coping with their disabled family member.
Assessment and diagnosis
In Australia, the diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder is usually made by a child
psychiatrist or a paediatrician. The complete assessment is multi-disciplinary. A paediatrician
will perform a physical examination and arrange appropriate investigations, including a search
for Fragile-X chromosome and an audiological assessment. Cognitive function will be assessed
by a psychologist using an instrument such as the WAIS-R 4th edition. A speech pathologist will
assess communication ability. An occupational therapist or physiotherapist will evaluate sensory
and motor integration.
Using the DSM-IV criteria, the most serious disorder, autistic disorder, requires symptoms from
each of the following three categories1
:
1. Impairment in social interaction
There may be limited nonverbal behaviours; a failure to make friends; no interest in sharing
activities with others; and a lack of reciprocity in social interactions.
2. Impaired communication
There may be a delay in, or a total lack of development of spoken language; an inability to
initiate or sustain a conversation with others; stereotyped and repetitive use of language; or
a lack of age appropriate spontaneous make-believe or social imitative play.
3. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities
These include a preoccupation with one or more restricted patterns of interest; inflexible
adherence to specific, non-functional routines or rituals; motor mannerisms; and a
preoccupation with parts of objects. Some examples of these impairments, and some
commonly associated features, are listed in Table 24-2.
The diagnosis of autistic disorder requires symptoms of impaired social
interaction, impaired communication, and the presence of restricted repetitive
and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities.
In contrast to autistic disorder, language development is not delayed in Asperger’s disorder (i.e.
single words are used by the age of two years, and the child communicates in phrases by age
three). Nor are there significant delays in cognitive development, or in the development of ageappropriate self-help skills, adaptive behaviour (other than in social interaction), and curiosity
about the environment1
. However, despite having normal language development, the higher1

level communication skills of these children are usually impaired, i.e. understanding metaphor
and humour and the ability to modulate tone of voice appropriately.
Differential diagnosis
In contrast to autism, schizophrenia usually develops after a period of normal development and
requires the presence of specific psychotic symptoms. In selective mutism, the communication
difficulties are restricted to specific situations. Children with language disorders lack the
impairments in social interaction and do not exhibit the repetitive stereotyped behaviours of
pervasive developmental disorders. An additional diagnosis of autism is only made in children
with mental retardation if the specific deficits in communication and social interaction and
specific stereotyped behaviours are present.
Co-morbidity
Around 75 per cent of autistic children suffer mental retardation. By age 20, approximately one
third have suffered an epileptic seizure.

Around 75 per cent of children with autism suffer mental retardation.
Epidemiology
The prevalence of autistic disorder is estimated to be around 2–5 per 10,000. Some Australian
studies suggest that the prevalence may be as high as 10 per 10,0001
. Males are affected four
times as frequently as females.
Familial pattern
There is an increased risk among the siblings of those with autism.
Course
The DSM-IV criteria for autism require an onset before the age of three years. The illness
follows a continuous course. Some gains in social skills may be made during school years.
Higher IQ is predictive of better functioning. Few people with autism are able to live and work
independently as adults, but some partial independence is achieved in about a third of cases.
Treatment
The aims of treatment are to minimise symptoms, to promote the development of the child,
and to provide support to families and carers. While pharmacological treatments are of use in
reducing unwanted behaviours, the main interventions are rehabilitative. Parents and teachers
need to be involved in treatment. The general practitioner is often responsible for coordinating
the care for these individuals. It is essential to educate parents and other professionals working
with children with pervasive developmental disorders about the characteristics of the disorder,
its diagnosis, prognosis and possible interventions.
General practitioners are well placed to coordinate the care of individuals with
pervasive developmental disorders.
Education
The education of children with a pervasive development disorder focuses on the acquisition of
daily living skills, with special emphasis on improving the primary deficits in communication
and social skills. Where possible, teaching is incorporated into naturally occurring activities.
Within the classroom, autistic children often respond better to visual images than to words.
Communication therapy
Following an assessment of how, what and with whom the child presently communicates, therapy
seeks to extend the child’s ability to communicate with others. Initially, nonverbal communication
by use of gestures and objects may be used. Pictures and other visual representations may be
used to introduce the spoken and written word. The use of facilitated communication in which
a person assists the child in pointing to letters on a board is controversial. It has been repeatedly
shown to reflect communication of the facilitator rather than the child. In some cases, parents
have been accused, though never convicted, of child sexual abuse on the basis of facilitated
communication.
Behaviour therapy
The behaviour therapies outlined in the section on ‘parental advice’ are used in managing some
of the difficult behaviours exhibited by these children. Parents need to be aware of the limited
capabilities of these children, especially those who also suffer mental retardation. In addition,
there is also a place for the use of aversive procedures for the management of self-destructive
behaviours.
Pharmacological therapy
A balance must be achieved between symptom reduction and the adverse side effects of
medication, especially sedation. It is therefore essential, prior to commencing treatment, to

Developmental Disorders. 2nd Ed. New York: John Wiley, 1997: 951-956.
Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 241
carefully monitor baseline behaviours and set specific targets for symptom reduction, and to
review the efficacy of treatment on this basis. Parents, teachers and other adults involved in the
child’s care should be consulted in setting the goals of treatment and in assessing its outcomes.
When prescribing medication, a balance must be sought between symptom
reduction and the adverse effects of medication.
Until recently, the most commonly used drug was haloperidol, which is effective in reducing
stereotypies, hyperactivity, distractibility and aggressive behaviour. Recommended doses begin
with 0.25–0.5mg orally per day, increasing if necessary up to 0.05mg/kg/day orally1
. Side effects
include sedation, acute dystonia and dyskinesias. On cessation of the medication, dyskinetic
symptoms have been reported to disappear in between a week and eight months. Because of its
more favourable side effect profile, risperidone is now used more often.
Other agents that have been used include fenfluramine, naltrexone, tricyclic antidepressants, beta
blockers, clonidine, buspirone and SSRIs. I recommend referral to a child psychiatrist for advice
on prescribing these.
Social skills training
The aim of social skills training is to make children with pervasive development disorders
more aware of the needs of others, to teach them to play, and to increase their interest in
social interaction. Training groups often involve the participation of other children in shared,
pleasurable activities that do not require complex communication. Programs also aim to improve
communication skills in social situations.
Individual therapy
Because of the communication problems, it is difficult to form a therapeutic alliance with people
with pervasive development disorders. However, for those with adequate language skills, attempts
should be made to understand the interests and views of the child. A balance is sought between
acknowledgment and validation of the child’s perspective, and helping him or her to meet the
demands of the environment. A goal of therapy is to help children gain an understanding of their
disability, how they differ from other disabled children, and how they can gain assistance. The
techniques of supportive psychotherapy are generally applicable (see Chapter 8). The principles
of counselling and structured problem solving described in Chapter 6 can be used to help
the sufferer deal with the stressors of everyday life. In particular, you may need to explain the
consequences of intended actions that the sufferer has not anticipated.
Family issues
Having an autistic child in the family is stressful to parents and other family members. Moreover,
parents are often confused by conflicting advice over diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, in
particular over claims of the latest fads in treatment. They may be puzzled by the uneven
development of the child across different skill areas. For example, the child may have normal
visio-spatial and motor skills, but deficits in language and social interaction. They may be
uncertain whether a child’s behaviour problems represent oppositional behaviour or an inability
to understand what should be done. Unlike children with other disabilities, the autistic child’s
normal appearance often belies his or her disabilities. Parents may be embarrassed by difficult
behaviours in public.
The key interventions are education about the illness and about child development. Parents
may benefit from learning the behavioural approaches described in the section on ‘advice on
parenting’. Teach structured problem solving to help parents deal with the stress of having a
disabled child, and with intercurrent stressors. Refer parents to relevant community organisations
that offer support, advice, assessment, treatment and respite.

Non-government organisations
Autistic associations in each state provide education, therapy, support and training services to
people with autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Asperger’s syndrome, and to their
families and others involved in their care.
Employment
The majority of sufferers will not find work in open employment. Supported employment
options include sheltered workshops, and situations in which a supervisor accompanies one or
a small number of clients to the workplace.
Residential options
Most children with a PDD live with their parents. In Queensland, respite services are available
through the Intellectual Disability Services and the Autistic Association Queensland.
Anorexia nervosa
The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is made on the basis of a refusal to maintain normal weight
(more than 15 per cent below that expected); fear of gaining weight or weight phobia; disturbance
of body image (i.e. perceiving one’s emaciated body as fat); and amenorrhoea.
The DSM-IV recognises two types of the disorder. In the binge eating type, the sufferer regularly
engages in binge-eating or purging behaviour (i.e. self-induced vomiting or the misuse of
laxatives, diuretics or enemas). In the restricting subtype, weight loss is accomplished through
dieting, fasting or excessive exercise.
Differential diagnosis
Unlike those with anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia nervosa are able to maintain their
weight at or above normal levels. It is important to exclude physical conditions that can cause
weight loss, including cancer and brain tumours. Depressed young people may suffer weight loss
as a result of poor appetite, but they do not have the specific body image disturbance and fear of
obesity characteristic of the person with anorexia. Appetite is usually only decreased in anorexia
when there is severe weight loss. The agitation of the depressed person may be confused with
the over-activity of the person with anorexia nervosa.
Epidemiology
The disorder predominantly affects females among whom the prevalence is around one per cent.
Anorexia nervosa is rare in boys and is associated with a poor prognosis. While the prevalence
among females appears to have been falling over recent years, the prevalence in young men may
be rising. Although the condition of anorexia nervosa is rare, dieting among adolescent girls
is very common. The peak age of onset for anorexia nervosa is between 15 and 17 years. The
diagnosis is rarely made before puberty.
Family pattern
There is an increased incidence of anorexia nervosa and mood disorders among first-degree
relatives.
Complications
The disorder may be complicated by depression. Cognitive changes produced by starvation
include a preoccupation with food, and a concrete, black and white style of thinking. Those who
have a pattern of purging and binge eating may exhibit other impulse control problems such as
substance abuse. They are especially prone to suffering mood disorders.
Cognitive changes produced by starvation include a preoccupation with food
and a concrete, black and white style of thinking.
Physical complications include amenorrhoea, electrolyte abnormalities, anaemia, bradycardia and
other arrhythmias, cold intolerance, hypotension, hypothermia, the development of lanugo hair,

and osteoporosis. Complications of purging include loss of dental enamel, calluses on the hands
and parotid enlargement. Persistent laxative abuse can lead to constipation and megacolon.
Physical complications of purging include electrolyte abnormalities, cardiac
dysrhythmias, loss of dental enamel, calluses on the hands and parotid
enlargement.
Prognosis
About 40 per cent of people recover fully, another 40 per cent recover to some degree, and
the remaining 20 per cent follow a chronic course. The long-term mortality rate in patients
admitted to university hospitals in the USA is over 10 per cent. Poor prognostic indicators
include chronicity, older age at onset, very low weight, the presence of bulimia and vomiting,
and poor childhood adjustment.
Formulation
A comprehensive bio-psychosocial formulation is required for each individual.
Biological factors
Evidence from family and twin studies demonstrates some genetic predisposition to the
condition. The effects of starvation itself may perpetuate some of the behaviours typical of the
condition.
Psychological factors
A pervasive sense of powerlessness coupled to an intense desire to exert control is an important
psychological characteristic of the condition. The strict adherence to a diet can be seen as a
way of maintaining control at a time when the girl is facing the many changes and demands of
adolescence. The dieting itself may cause amenorrhoea and arrest physical development. Starvation
tends to accentuate a rather rigid, black and white, concrete cognitive style. Paradoxically, the
starvation also causes a compulsive preoccupation with food, calorie counting, and cooking.
The anorexic girl’s strict adherence to a diet can be seen as a way of
maintaining control at a time when she is facing the many changes and
demands of adolescence.
Social factors
Social factors in the aetiology of anorexia nervosa include societal expectations that young
women should be thin. The families of some young people with anorexia are characterised
by patterns of over-involvement, rigidity, a diminished expression of affect, a lack of conflict
resolution and a high emphasis placed on achievement. However, it is often unclear whether
these are a cause or effect of the illness. Food is often an important means of communication
within these families, and it becomes the vehicle for the girl’s rebellion and the means through
which she seeks to establish a sense of autonomy from the family. There is an increased incidence
of eating disorder, affective disorder and alcoholism in the families of women with anorexia.
Treatment
In many cases, treatment can be managed on an outpatient basis. Following are some principles
of treatment:
1. setting a target weight—for example, ideal body weight or BMI of 20–25 (see Table 24-3)
2. forming a therapeutic alliance and reaching an agreement with the girl to increase weight
by one kg/per week until ideal body weight is reached
3. coordination with a dietician who can advise on a diet that will produce a steady weight
gain
4. as weight is gained, dealing, in individual therapy with psychological and social issues that
244
come to the fore, including adolescent conflicts over identity, autonomy and sexuality
5. family therapy to address issues of separation and autonomy, dealing with adverse emotional
reactions (guilt, shame and anger), counselling and structured problem solving to address
conflicts and other stressors within the family
6. indications for inpatient care include:
•	 rapid weight loss
•	 extreme weight loss (hospital admission is advised if weight falls below a BMI of 16)
•	 electrolyte disturbance, especially in the person who has concurrent bulimia and vomiting
(death may result from hypokalemia)
•	 severe depression with suicidal intent.
Bulimia nervosa
The disorder is characterised by episodes of binge eating and compensatory behaviour to prevent
weight gain. A binge is an episode in which a large amount of food is consumed in a short
period of time, accompanied by a sense of loss of control. Compensatory behaviours include
self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas or other medications; fasting; and
excessive exercise. The person’s self-esteem is strongly influenced by her evaluation of her body
shape and weight.
Differential diagnosis
The disorder needs to be distinguished from neurological disorders (including epilepsy and CNS
tumour) and schizophrenia. Unlike those with anorexia nervosa, people with bulimia nervosa
are usually within the normal weight range or slightly overweight. Whereas those with anorexia
nervosa of the restricting type tend to be excessively controlled and rigid in their behaviour,
people with bulimia often have difficulty controlling their impulses. In addition to bingeing, this
lack of control may be manifest in substance abuse, promiscuity and self-harming. Between 30
and 50 per cent of sufferers have features of personality dysfunction, most commonly, borderline
personality disorder.
Whereas people with anorexia nervosa (restricting type) tend to be excessively
controlled and rigid in their behaviour, those with bulimia often have difficulty
controlling their impulses.
Epidemiology
Bulimia is a disorder of Western industrialised countries. Ninety per cent of sufferers are female.
The prevalence among adolescent girls and young women is between one and three per cent.
Course
The disorder usually begins in late adolescence or early adulthood. It often persists with
intermittent exacerbations and remissions occurring over a number of years.
Complications
The disorder is associated with depression, personality disorder, anxiety disorders and substance
abuse.
Table 24-3: Calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI)
Body Mass Index is calculated using the formula: weight in kilograms/[height in meters]2
For adults, a healthy BMI is between 20 and 25. For adolescents, it is a little lower, between 18.5
and 25.
A BMI less than 16 is an indication for hospitalization.
Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 245
Mental disorders commonly associated with bulimia include depression,
personality disorder, anxiety disorder and substance abuse.
Medical complications include loss of dental enamel and parotid enlargement due to selfinduced vomiting. Menstrual irregularities may occur. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances may be
complicated by cardiac arrhythmias. Rare complications include oesophageal tears and gastric
rupture.
Family pattern
There is an increased incidence of bulimia nervosa, mood disorders and substance abuse in the
relatives of people with bulimia nervosa.
Treatment
•	 Therapeutic alliance
Building a therapeutic alliance is often difficult. Sufferers are often secretive about their
bingeing and ambivalent about abandoning their symptoms. Alternatively, they may have
unrealistic expectations of rapid cure.
•	 Monitor for complications
Check for the physical complications. In particular, serum electrolytes should be monitored
in the young woman who is purging.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in patients who purge.
•	 Education
Explain to the young person the nature of the illness, its prevalence and theories of its cause;
how starvation may in turn lead to bingeing and depressed mood; and the potential physical
and psychological complications of the disorder. People also need clear nutritional advice.
•	 Goal setting
The person needs advice on setting realistic goals. The aim of therapy is not to lose weight,
but to stop bingeing, to understand the reasons for the behaviour, and to find more adaptive
solutions to his or her problems.
•	 Stabilise eating
The person should be advised not to restrict intake, but to eat three normal meals a day.
Advice may be sought from a dietician.
•	 Individual psychotherapy
Explain the impact of stress on symptoms. Ask her to make a diary to document the relationship
between stressful events and bingeing. Use structured problem solving to deal with current
stressors.
Use counselling and structured problem solving to identify and cope with
current stressors.
Use cognitive behavioural techniques to correct cognitive distortions. These commonly include
black and white thinking, such as ‘All sweet food is bad. Therefore, I can only eat low-calorie
food’; over-emphasising the negative, ‘I have put on one kilogram so I might as well give up’
or ‘I have eaten a cake. Therefore I have no control’; magical thinking, ‘Anything sweet goes
straight to fat’; or mind reading, ‘He doesn’t speak to me. Therefore, he must think I am too fat’
(see also Chapter 10).
Typical underlying assumptions include the belief that one must be approved of by others to be
a good person, and more specifically, that others must approve of one’s body shape and weight.
In challenging these assumptions, it is important to recognise the fact that many people in our
society do place a high value on people being slim. The approach should be to challenge the
246
validity of these attitudes and to help the individual accept that one does not have to be perfect
and thin in order to be a good person.
Some patients may need to deal with issues of past sexual abuse (see also Chapter 21).
•	 Family therapy
Educate the family about the nature of the disorder and use the principles of counselling
and structured problem solving to help the family deal with precipitating stressors. However,
remember that adolescents will also need individual therapy, separate from their families.
•	 Behavioural approaches
Ask the person to identify the cues to binge eating and help them find alternative responses.
These might include avoidance (e.g. planning social activities to avoid long periods alone,
taking another route home to avoid passing the delicatessen) or distraction (e.g. going for a
walk, listening to music, performing a relaxation exercise). The principles of exposure and
response prevention are also applicable (e.g. eating sweet foods without bingeing).
•	 Medication
Antidepressants, especially SSRIs, may be of benefit, particularly if the person suffers comorbid depression. Do not prescribe tricyclic antidepressants to this group.
Indications for specialist referral include:
•	 failure of the above treatments
•	 severe family psychopathology
•	 severe co-morbid disorders such as depression, substance abuse, borderline personality
disorder
•	 medical complications of the disorder
•	 a history of past sexual abuse.
Indications for hospitalisation include:
•	 BMI below 16
•	 chaotic eating and uncontrollable vomiting
•	 electrolyte disturbance
•	 hematemesis
•	 emaciation
•	 severe depression
•	 suicidality.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
The topic is controversial. Is it a medical disorder or is it merely a collection of difficult behaviours
that are ‘labelled’ a disorder? Is there a qualitative difference between children with the disorder
and those without it, or is it merely a matter of degree? If it is just a matter of degree, where
do we draw the line? Should we be treating children with amphetamines? Why is the reported
prevalence of the condition so varied (between 0.1 per cent and 20 per cent)? Why do most
prescriptions for Ritalin originate from a small number of medical practitioners?
Diagnosis
The diagnosis is based on persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity with
some symptoms presenting before the age of seven and causing significant disability and handicap
in at least two settings (e.g. school and home). Symptoms of inattention include inattention to
details, difficulty sustaining attention, not listening when spoken to, failing to follow through
on instructions, difficulty organising tasks (especially tasks requiring sustained mental effort),
losing things, being easily distracted and being forgetful. Symptoms of hyperactivity include
fidgeting, inability to remain seated, running and climbing in inappropriate situations, noisiness,
Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 247
being always on the go, and talking excessively. Signs of impulsivity include blurting out answers
to questions, difficulty waiting turn, and constantly interrupting. For the diagnosis to be made,
these symptoms need not merely to be present, but to be present often. Associated features
include low self-esteem, labile mood, temper tantrums, academic underachievement, and
accident proneness.
The diagnosis of ADHD requires persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity
and impulsivity with some symptoms presenting before age seven.
There are no specific laboratory findings. The positive and negative predictive values of various
complex and expensive tests are too low to be useful. There are no specific findings on physical
examination.
There are no reliable laboratory tests for ADHD.
Differential diagnosis
It is important to distinguish the symptoms of ADHD from age appropriate behaviours in
active children. Bright children placed in academically unstimulating environments may exhibit
behaviours similar to those with ADHD. Similarly, children from stressful, disorganised or
chaotic environments may manifest similar symptoms. It is important to make this distinction,
because the treatment will be very different. Treatment of ADHD may involve the prescription
of methylphenidate, which would be quite inappropriate in the case of children with what are
primarily psychosocial problems. However, in some cases, both problems may coexist. The onset
of depression and anxiety disorders is usually after the age of seven years. See also the diagnoses
of conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder on the following pages.
Epidemiology
The disorder is more commonly diagnosed in boys. The male to female ratio is between 4:1 and
9:1. It has been estimated that between 0.1 and 5.0 per cent of school age children suffer from
the disorder.
Familial pattern
In the families of children with ADHD there is an increased prevalence of ADHD, mood and
anxiety disorders, learning disorders, substance related disorders and anti-social personality
disorder.
Prognosis
The course of the disorder is variable. In some cases, the hyperactivity remits, while the inattention
tends to persist. In most cases, the symptoms attenuate during late adolescence, but in some cases,
the symptoms persist into early adulthood. The disorder is associated with learning difficulties
and with the later development of anti-social personality disorder and mood disorders.
It is important to distinguish between the symptoms of ADHD and age
appropriate behaviours in active children, or in children under stress.
Treatment
Non-pharmacological interventions include parenting advice (see pp 259–264), behavioural
interventions (see Chapter 9), family assessment, support and counselling (see Chapter 5), problem
solving (see Chapter 6), and the provision of practical advice such as the availability of respite.
The roles of the general practitioner include making a thorough biopsychosocial assessment
of the presenting problems, referring likely cases for specialist assessment, and coordinating the
different professionals involved.
The assessment and treatment of ADHD is usually multi-disciplinary with a child psychiatrist
or paediatrician confirming the diagnosis and advising on the use of medication. A psychologist
248
will often perform a neuro-psychological assessment, provide baseline measurement of target
symptoms, and formulate a behaviour program. Audiometry, dietary advice and family therapy
may be indicated. It is essential to liaise closely with the child’s teacher and to provide clear
written instructions if medication is to be dispensed at school.
Biological treatments include methylphenidate (Ritalin) at a dose of between 0.3mg and 0.8mg/
kg/day, or dexamphetamine 0.15–0.4 mg/kg/day, in divided doses, in the morning and at
midday. The duration of effect is around four hours, but with considerable individual variation1
.
Side effects include abdominal discomfort, decreased appetite, insomnia, headache, irritability,
depressed mood, a delay in the height and weight spurt at puberty, and the risk of amphetamine
abuse. There may be a rebound of symptoms as the medication starts to wear off in the evening.
Stimulants may worsen tics. Drug holidays may be advisable over weekends or during school
holidays. A trial without medication during the school term is advisable after 6–12 months of
therapy.
Methylphenidate is prescribed in doses of 0.3–0.8 mg/kg/day, in divided doses,
in the morning and at midday. Doses of dexamphetamine are between 0.15 and
0.4 mg/kg/day.
Tricyclics and clonidine are sometimes used in the treatment of ADHD. I recommend seeking
specialist advice before prescribing these.
If medication is prescribed, it is advisable to document outcome using an instrument such as
the ADHD Rating Scale administered before and after a trial of treatment2
. One of the child’s
parents and a teacher are asked to complete the rating, indicating the frequency of each symptom
on the Likert scale by selecting the single item that best describes the child.
Conduct disorder
The diagnosis of conduct disorder is made on the basis of a pattern of behaviours that violate
the norms of our society and the rights of others. Such behaviours include aggression to people
and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness and stealing, and other serious violations
of the rules. These behaviours cause significant handicap at school, at work and in personal
relationships.
Differential diagnosis
The behaviours are more serious than in oppositional defiant disorder and include those that
infringe the rights of others, aggression towards people and animals, property destruction, theft
and deceit. The recent onset of antisocial behaviour in a previously well-behaved child raises the
possibility of depression, mania or substance abuse.
Aetiology and associated conditions
Antisocial behaviour tends to run in families. Associated conditions include criminality, alcoholism
(especially in fathers) and somatisation (especially in mothers). Social factors in the aetiology
of conduct disorder include parental discord and antisocial behaviour in parents. Psychological
factors include deficits in the capacity to experience guilt or remorse; a failure to see rules as
important; an inability to understand the consequences of one’s actions, including their impact
on others; and a lack of mutuality and reciprocity in relationships. Developmental problems are
often evident, especially in more severe cases. Low IQ and impaired attention, concentration,
memory and abstraction may be found. These may in turn be the result of an injury sustained
during a violent and chaotic upbringing.

Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 249
Epidemiology
The disorder is present in between four and 10 per cent of children and adolescents. The rate is
twice as high in boys than in girls.
Prognosis
The prognosis is fair to poor. It is the most stable of childhood diagnoses over time. The disorder
may progress to antisocial personality disorder in adulthood. The death rates for conductdisordered youths are about 50 times those for normal youths. Deaths occur through accidents,
suicide, homicide (especially in the US) and drug overdose.
Assessment
In addition to an assessment of the child’s difficult behaviours, it is important to note his or
her social strengths, as these form the basis upon which progress can be made. Family issues are
important. Are the problematic behaviours modelled on those of other family members? How
do families respond to antisocial behaviours? What is the state of the parents’ marriage? Are the
parents united in their approach to dealing with the problems?
Treatment
As a group, these are probably the most difficult conditions in child and adolescent psychiatry to
treat. The children rarely present themselves for treatment, but rather are brought to see you at
the insistence of schoolteachers, community agencies, the courts or parents. Transference issues
arise quickly, particularly in those who feel most helpless. These young people may act out in
the consultation by manipulation, stonewalling or even by making threats.
Psychosocial Treatments
Only children with the milder forms of conduct disorder respond favourably to outpatient
counselling. For the more severe cases, behavioural programs with firm limits and predictable
consequences for misdeeds are required.
Caregivers must be able to cooperate with the behavioural program. Advise them to change
coercive and inconsistent methods of discipline. Encourage them to set rules, negotiate
compromises, and offer concrete rewards for behaviours that help others. Family sessions may be
used to clarify patterns of communication, to help family members recognise certain behaviours,
and to teach problem solving (see also section on ‘advice on parenting’, pp 259–264).
Enlist the support of parents in programs that aim to improve a child’s
behaviour.
In the countertransference, it is wise to avoid over-reacting to the child’s problematic behaviours.
It is the child who must learn self-control. Focus on concrete issues, using counselling and
structured problem solving. While psychodynamics may help you understand the problems, the
interpretation of defences and other techniques of psychodynamic psychotherapy are generally
not useful. Give parents clear advice and support.
Drug treatments
The prescription of drugs in this group is fraught with difficulties. Drugs may be hoarded, sold
or taken in overdose. It is probably best to seek specialist advice before prescribing any drugs to
these young people.
Drugs prescribed to adolescents with conduct disorders may be hoarded, sold,
abused or taken in overdose.
Oppositional defiant disorder
This disorder is characterised by a persistent pattern of negativistic, disobedient, hostile and
defiant behaviour towards parents, teachers and other authority figures. The child often loses
250
his or her temper, argues with adults, defies adult’s requests, deliberately annoys people, blames
others for his or her mistakes, is easily annoyed by others, and is often angry, resentful, spiteful
and vindictive. Associated features include irritability and mood disorder, low self-esteem, low
frustration tolerance and the precocious use of substances.
Differential diagnosis
Some oppositional behaviour is a normal part of the development of a child’s autonomy. It
is only pathological if it is frequent, severe, and causes significant disability and handicap. The
behaviours are not as severe as those found in conduct disorder. Unlike conduct disorder, the
syndrome does not usually include aggression to people and animals, property destruction or a
pattern of theft and deceit. The onset of oppositional behaviours in children and adolescents who
have had no previous behaviour problems raises the possibility of depression, anxiety disorders,
psychotic disorders or substance abuse.
Epidemiology
The prevalence has been estimated to be between 2 per cent and 16 per cent1
. The disorder is
more prevalent in boys before puberty, but the rates are thought to be equal in young men and
women after puberty.
Familial pattern
In the families of children with the disorder, there are increased rates of depression, antisocial
personality disorder and substance abuse. Parents may have a history of conduct disorder,
ADHD or oppositional defiant disorder. The disorder is more common in families with marital
discord.2
Course and prognosis
The symptoms usually appear before the age of eight years. The oppositional symptoms are
almost always evident at home, but may also appear at school and in other situations. It may
develop into conduct disorder.
Unlike conduct disorder, the syndrome of oppositional defiant disorder does
not usually include aggression to people and animals, property destruction,
stealing or other serious illegal activities.
Treatment
Parents are offered advice on managing the difficult behaviours (see Parenting Advice, pp
259–264). In individual therapy, children can express their autonomy in a non-controlling
environment. The therapist can also diagnose and treat co-morbid depression, low self-esteem,
substance abuse or psychosis.
Depression and suicide
The problem of adolescent depression has been neglected in the past, in part because of an
adherence to the ideological belief that children could not suffer major depression owing to the
supposed immaturity of their superego development. The falsity of this belief is emphasised by
the recent alarming increase in the rate of adolescent suicide.
Epidemiology
The prevalence of depression in 10-year-olds presenting to GPs is around two per cent. Among
young people referred to psychiatrists, five per cent of pre-pubertal children and 15–30 per cent
of adolescents suffer from depression. Suicide is the leading cause of death for people under the
age of thirty. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reports that the rate for 15 to 24 yearold males has tripled since 1960, whilst the same trend has not been observed in the equivalent

female cohort. Australia has the highest rate of suicide in young people in the world. For 15 to
24 year olds, the rate is 16.4 per 100,000 per year. Queensland’s adolescent suicide rate is two
per cent above the national average (18.4/100.000).
Suicide is currently the leading cause of death in males between the ages of 15
and 24 years.
Adolescent males living in rural areas have a higher suicide rate than do the corresponding urban
cohort. Moreover, these rates are increasing. In 1986 the rate of suicide among young males
from rural areas was 24/100,000. By 1992 the rate had reached 36/100,000. The corresponding
urban rates in 1986 and 1992 were 21/100,000 and 26/100,000 respectively. The reverse trend
applies for females, with figures for urban areas being slightly higher (5/100,000) than for rural
areas (4/100,000).
Assessment and diagnosis
Depressed children and adolescents present with somewhat different symptoms and signs than
do depressed adults. Children may have difficulty describing their mood and present instead with
somatic symptoms. Their parents may bring them to see you because of behavioural problems—
aggression, withdrawal, deterioration in school performance, disruption of peer relationships or
school refusal. The predominant mood may be irritability rather than depression. Anger, often
directed at parents, may be a feature.
Determine whether there has been any loss of interest or pleasure in their usual activities
(anhedonia). Begin by asking about their hobbies and interests, and then assess whether there
has been any recent change in their participation in these activities. Ask when they last did
something they really enjoyed.
Poor concentration may lead to deterioration in school performance. Assess the level of
hopelessness by asking about plans for the future. Listen for statements that ‘no one can help’ or
‘nothing can help’ and other evidence of helplessness. Ask about neurovegetative symptoms—
insomnia, poor appetite, weight loss, diurnal mood variation and low energy levels. Observe
any psychomotor retardation or agitation. Depressed young people frequently suffer co-morbid
anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks, obsessions and compulsions. Rarely, there may be
psychotic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations or delusions). Ask a depressed young (man) about any
ideas he has of suicide or self-harm, but be prepared to follow up with a discussion of alternative
ways of problem solving (see following ).
The commonest diagnosis, especially in children between 8 and 11 years old, is dysthymic
disorder, rather than major depression. This syndrome is characterised by depressed or irritable
mood on most days of the week over a period of at least one year. While the symptoms may not
be as severe as in major depression, the level of disability and handicap, manifest by poor school
performance and problems with peers and family, is often high. It is often associated with a low
self-esteem and a perception of being unloved by parents, siblings, peers, teachers and others
in the social environment. It may be complicated by the development of major depression in
adolescence.
In children between the ages of 8 and 11 years, the commonest depressive
syndrome is dysthymic disorder, characterised by chronic depressed or irritable
mood, low self-esteem and a perception of being unloved.
Differential diagnosis
Physical disorders and substances that can cause depression are listed in Tables 17-5 and 17-7.
As mentioned above, anxiety symptoms often occur in depressive disorders. It is important
to distinguish the agitation of depression from the restlessness of ADHD. The first onset of
symptoms in a child who previously had no behaviour problems is unlikely to be due to ADHD.
252
In older children and adolescents, consider the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.
Formulation
Biological factors that should be considered in the formulation of a young person with depression
include underlying physical illness or substance abuse, and a family history of affective disorder
(especially bipolar disorder). Psychological factors to consider include any past history of
depression, substance abuse, conduct disorder or self-harm. Social factors include family, school
or relationship problems. Parental separation and divorce, mental illness in a parent (especially
alcoholism, depression and suicide), and physical, emotional or sexual abuse is associated with the
development of depression in young people. Children with dysthymic disorder often perceive
that they are unloved.
Treatment
•	 This will depend on the individual formulation. The first step is to form an effective therapeutic
alliance with the young person and the family.
•	 Educating the child and the family about depression, its symptoms, causes, prognosis and
treatment will often, in itself, provide some relief. It will also improve adherence to treatment
and follow-up.
•	 Deal with any family problems that are uncovered in the assessment. This might, for example,
include the treatment of a depressed parent.
•	 Use the psychological therapies described in Chapters 6-12. In treating young people, you
will have to see the individual alone and together with the rest of the family. Cognitive
behavioural treatment is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, including
dysthymic disorder.
•	 Aim to minimise the disability and handicap associated with the depression. For example, if
school refusal is a feature, insist on a return to school. It may be necessary to enlist the support
of parents and teachers to ensure that this occurs.
If school refusal is a feature, insist on a return to school.
•	 I recommend the use of an SSRI in the treatment of major depression in adolescents at the
usual adult doses. Tricyclics can cause sudden death and may be lethal in overdose.
•	 Arrange for referral to a specialist child psychiatrist or mental health service if there is
poor response to treatment, if the child has serious suicidal intent, if there is serious family
disturbance, or if the depression is severe—for example, with psychotic symptoms.
Assessment of suicidality (see also Chapter 3)
In assessing a young person’s suicide risk, take into account the following population risk factors.
Young men commit suicide at a rate around four times that of young women. Suicide rates in
young people increase with age—suicide is a very rare event in pre-pubertal children. Family
factors that are associated with increased risk include broken homes, early loss of a parent,
mental illness in a parent (especially alcoholism, depression and suicide), and physical, emotional
or sexual abuse. Associated diagnoses in the young person include depression, conduct disorder
and substance abuse. Four per cent of those who deliberately self-harm go on to complete
suicide within the next two years.
Ask about a young person’s suicidal intent. Recent research shows that discussing the option of
suicide may influence a depressed child or adolescent to act upon it. His or her problem solving
capacity may be so severely impaired that any suggested solution may be adopted. Therefore, you
should be prepared to follow up any inquiry about suicide with a discussion of alternative ways
of coping. Reach an agreement with the young person to use the alternative plan should ideas
of self-harm or suicide recur.
Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 253
Be prepared to follow up an inquiry about suicidality with a discussion of
alternative problem solving strategies.
Try to distinguish ideas of self-harm from ideas of suicide. Ask what the child believed was
the risk of dying. Ask whether the plan included any ideas of being rescued. Assess a child’s
understanding of death and its permanence by asking what he or she expects to happen after
death.
Suicidal and self-harming behaviour are maladaptive solutions to problems in the young person’s
life. Try to identify the precipitating problem. Many suicides and suicide attempts occur in
the context of relationship problems. The meaning of suicide may, in some cases, be to send a
message, often an angry message, to someone important in that person’s life. The risk of suicide
is higher if someone known to the young person has committed suicide. In some cases, problems
over sexual orientation may lead an adolescent to contemplate suicide.
Determine the nature of the underlying mental disorder. The commonest diagnosis is depression.
In particular, you should assess hopelessness by asking what the young person sees for the future.
Other disorders associated with an increased risk of suicide include anxiety disorders, alcohol
and other substance abuse, conduct disorder and psychosis.
Disorders commonly associated with suicidal ideation and behaviour include
depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol and other substance abuse, conduct
disorder and psychosis.
Assess the availability of means, in particular the young person’s access to firearms. Ask about any
previous suicide attempts, their frequency and lethality, and their motivation. Assess the level of
disability and handicap by asking about functioning at home, at school and with peers.
Interview the family to obtain collateral information. Many depressed children believe that
they are to blame for family problems. In some cases, parents may consciously or unconsciously
promote such a belief. On the other hand, family support and cohesion, shared interests with
other family members, and family support are protective.
Treatment and prevention of suicidality
The cornerstone of treatment is the accurate diagnosis and treatment of the underlying mental
(or physical) disorder. Take steps to limit the young person’s access to the means of committing
suicide, in particular to lethal means such as firearms. Reach an agreement with the child and
his or her family and carers to seek help before self-harming. Use counselling and structured
problem solving techniques to deal with the precipitating problem. Mobilise family and social
networks to provide support. Refer for specialist assessment if no safety agreement can be made,
if there is severe family disruption or if the child is suffering severe depressive symptoms. See
Chapter 3 for a more detailed description of these issues.
Anxiety disorders
An anxiety disorder is present when the normal fight and flight response to a threatening
stimulus is exaggerated, if it occurs at times when there is no realistic threat, or persists after the
threat has been removed.
The diagnosis may be associated with particular patterns of disability and handicap. The physical
symptoms may be taken as evidence of a medical condition and lead to extensive physical
investigations. It may be associated with school refusal, which may in turn be reinforced by the
secondary gains of staying at home. School refusal causes significant disability and handicap—
academic problems, a loss of friends and becoming the victim of bullies. The child who reacts
to minor stimuli with a fight/flight response may be seen as disobedient. Insomnia may lead
to fatigue, irritability and a deterioration in school performance. The child’s condition will
254
also have an impact on other family members. See also Chapter 15 for a detailed discussion of
anxiety disorders.
Disability and handicap associated with anxiety disorders include school
problems, school refusal, insomnia and family problems.
Diagnosis
The history is gained from both the child and his or her parents. Useful collateral may be
obtained from schoolteachers and others with whom the child has contact. On the mental status
examination, the child may be tense, shaky, vigilant and quick to startle. Observe how the child
manages to separate from his or her parents.
In addition to the adult syndromes discussed in Chapter 15, the DSM IV includes Separation
Anxiety Disorder as an anxiety disorder specific to childhood and young adolescents. It is
characterised by excessive anxiety on separation from home or those to whom the person is
attached.
The differential diagnosis includes the abuse of substances (including caffeine), thyroid and
other endocrine disturbances, anaemia, and cardiac abnormalities. There may be anxiety about
unwanted pregnancy, or of having contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Anxiety disorders
are often co-morbid with depression. In conduct disorder, the child may stay away from home
or play truant from school, but has no anxiety about the separation. The diagnosis of a particular
anxiety disorder is often difficult, as a young person may present with features of several disorders.
Anxiety symptoms may also complicate other Axis I disorders such as ADHD.
Treatment
The treatment of anxiety disorders in children and young people follows the same principles as
the treatment of adults (see Chapter 15). Some examples are given below.
Behavioural techniques
1. Relaxation
Example: A youth with generalised anxiety symptoms is informed about the nature of anxiety,
taught controlled breathing, progressive muscular relaxation, advised how to use a relaxation
tape, and taught a self-hypnosis technique (see Appendices 4-6).
2. Exposure
Example: A nine-year-old girl who has a phobia of dogs is educated about the nature of
anxiety and, in particular, about the problem of avoidance behaviours. She is taught a
relaxation technique and is then progressively exposed, initially to pictures of dogs. In the
final session, she is able to pat a dog in the session. At each step, she is encouraged to stay in
the room with the therapist, using the relaxation technique, until her level of anxiety falls
(habituation).
3. Modelling
Example: An eight-year-old boy with needle phobia has his anxiety symptoms explained, as
well as the purpose of the injection. He attends the appointment at which his older brother,
who is not afraid of needles, has an injection.
4. Operant conditioning
Example: An eight-year-old boy with behaviour problems is rewarded for good behaviour
(e.g. doing the dishes, tidying his room, taking his younger sister for a walk) by being taken
to the cinema with his father (positive reinforcement). When he has a temper tantrum, he
has time-out in his bedroom (negative reinforcement), and when he hits his sister, he is
admonished (punishment).
Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 255
5. Cognitive-behavioural treatment
Example: A 13-year-old girl suffers symptoms of anxiety and depression. After assessing the
problems and documenting the levels of anxiety and depression using rating scales, you
explain the treatment and contract to see the girl for 12 sessions, once a week, over the
following three months. The girl is asked to keep a diary of the negative thoughts that she
has at times when she is feeling anxious and depressed. In the sessions, you challenge the
faulty logic behind these thoughts. Later, the girl is asked to challenge the thoughts herself,
both in the sessions and at times when she is suffering symptoms. She documents these in
her diary and rehearses possible responses within the sessions. At the end of 12 weeks, the
rating scales are again administered to assess the efficacy of treatment.
6. Other treatments
Although the primary treatment modality may be behavioural or cognitive-behavioural,
psychodynamic principles will often inform therapy.
Example: A three-year-old girl continues to suffer nightmares, bed-wetting and separation
anxiety nine months after her parents separated. She frequently sleeps in her mother’s bed
and she becomes very upset whenever her mother goes out.
The girl, who has always been pleasant, considerate, and friendly in play therapy, suddenly
becomes angry while hammering pegs through a wood block. She begins swinging the
mallet around her head, narrowly missing the therapist, all the time cackling with laughter.
The therapist stands up and quickly regains control.
Comment: The child’s anger with her father, previously repressed, is displaced on to the
therapist and acted out.
Family interventions are often required. A parent may suffer an anxiety disorder or other Axis I
condition. Parents may reinforce a child’s anxiety either by failing to give adequate support, or
by intervening too quickly to remove a child from situations that cause anxiety. Abused children
may present with anxiety symptoms, including those of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children
who are too powerful within a family may be anxious (e.g. a girl with school refusal has to stay
at home to support her mother who suffers delusions that the neighbours will kidnap her if she
is left alone).
Check for the presence of mental health problems in the family members of
children and adolescents with anxiety disorders.
Drug treatments may sometimes be used for specific symptoms. However, because of their
uncertain efficacy, and their side effects and toxicity, I recommend referral of any young person
requiring pharmacological treatment to a child psychiatrist.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder
Assessment and diagnosis
The diagnosis of the disorder is based on the presence of obsessions and compulsions (see
Chapter 15). The Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) may assist
assessment1
. Between one and four per cent of children suffer obsessive–compulsive symptoms.
Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes normal age-appropriate rituals of childhood. These differ
from obsessions and compulsions in their transience, and the lack of disability and handicap
1
 Goodman WK, Price LH. Assessment of severity and change in obsessive–compulsive disorder.
Psychiatric Clinics of North America 1992; 15:861-869.
256
associated with them. Obsessions and compulsions frequently occur in the context of depression
and other anxiety disorders. In a pure mood disorder, the mood symptoms will predominate.
However, both disorders may coexist. Tics may be preceded by a premonitory urge, but unlike
compulsions, they do not arise in response to an anxious thought or obsession. If the onset in
abrupt, consider possible physical causes, including viral and bacterial infections, and substance
abuse (especially amphetamine abuse).
Co-morbidity
The illness occurs most commonly together with other disorders with only around 25 per cent
of symptomatic individuals suffering OCD alone. Common co-morbid diagnoses include tic
disorders, depression, developmental disability, phobias and other anxiety disorders, oppositional
disorder, ADHD and conduct disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder occurs more frequently in combination with
other disorders than it does alone.
Treatment
Educating the family and the child about the nature of the illness will help establish a therapeutic
alliance.
Exposure and response prevention
The cornerstone of treatment is exposure and response prevention (see Chapter 15).
The cornerstone of the treatment of OCD is exposure and response prevention.
Pharmacological treatment
SSRIs are effective in the treatment of obsessions. The recommended dose of fluoxetine is 0.5
to 1mg/kg orally per day, in two divided doses (morning and noon) up to a maximum of 40mg
orally per day1
. Side effects include nervousness, agitation, insomnia, nausea, tremor and sexual
dysfunction.
Clomipramine is also effective, but care must be taken because of potential toxic effects, including
the risk of sudden death. I therefore recommend that specialist advice be sought before prescribing
a tricyclic antidepressant. ECGs should be performed before commencing clomipramine and at
intervals during treatment to exclude conduction abnormalities (see Psychotropic Drug Guidelines
on pages 155–156 and 163–1642
). Side effects of clomipramine include dry mouth, constipation,
tiredness, sweating, abdominal pain and tremor. Doses are between 2 and 5mg/kg/day orally as
a single dose or in two divided doses, and should not exceed 250mg/day. The dose should be
increased gradually. Response may not occur until four to ten weeks after an effective dose is
reached.
Individual therapy
In individual therapy, you should monitor for the development of co-morbid conditions and
address the disability and handicap associated with the illness.
Family therapy
In family therapy, you can address the involvement of other family members in the rituals. Assess
the impact of the illness on other family members. For example, siblings may resent the extra
attention given to the ill child. Family members may be exasperated by the behaviours and
react angrily to the child. The stress on the child may then worsen the symptoms. Parents who
themselves suffer the disorder may feel guilty that they have passed it on to their child.

Adjustment disorders
The reactions of young people to stress are complex. The quality of the adjustment will depend
on the nature of the event itself, the context in which it occurs (e.g. how parents respond to the
crisis), whether or not it precipitates chronic adversity (e.g. greater poverty), and the person’s
own personality and adaptation. Use counselling and structured problem solving to help the
young person and his or her family deal with their problems (see Appendix 3).
Divorce
Divorce is usually preceded by a period of marital conflict and family discord, and may be
followed by:
•	 parental conflict
•	 parental distress or illness
•	 changes of house and school
•	 loss of family income
•	 compromised relationships with either parent
•	 new parental relationships, including parental remarriage.
Boys may exhibit more externalising behaviours, including irritability and aggression, than girls,
but sex differences become fewer and perhaps more subtle as adolescence and young adulthood
is reached. Some adolescents experience parental divorce as a foreshortening of the amount of
time they have to grow up, and of being exposed and vulnerable. There is some evidence that as
they approach young adulthood, the children of divorced parents experience more interpersonal
relationship problems, including problems with intimacy. The severity of the problems may
be correlated with high pre-separation parental hostility, an inability of the mother (usually
the custodial parent) to form another stable relationship, and high levels of interference by
one parent in the relationship of the child with the other parent after separation. In helping
adolescents survive the process of divorce, use counselling and structured problem solving.
Encourage agreement to sensitive arrangements concerning custody and access.
Child abuse
It is important to intervene early in cases of child abuse in order to limit the physical and
psychological sequelae. The longer the abuse continues, the more severe the psychological
damage done. People who were abused as children may enter into abusive relationships in
adulthood, as victim or abuser. They are themselves at risk of becoming abusing parents.
Consider the following types of abuse:
•	 Physical abuse usually involves excessive punishment for minor infractions, or for behaviour
that is developmentally normal for the child.
•	 Emotional abuse may involve constant criticism, teasing and humiliation.
•	 Neglect is the failure to provide the child’s basic needs for shelter, food, clothing and the other
necessities of life.
•	 Emotional deprivation is the failure to provide the child with normal human contact, support
and warmth.
•	 Sexual abuse involves the exploitation of a young person by an older person who is in a
position of power over him or her. The perpetrator of the abuse may be a parent, sibling, other
relative or acquaintance.
Abuse includes physical abuse (i.e. excessive punishment, or punishment for
behaviour that is developmentally normal for the child), emotional abuse,
emotional deprivation, neglect and sexual abuse.
258
Evidence of abuse comes from a variety of sources. A third party may make allegations, the
child may disclose the abuse, or the general practitioner may notice signs of abuse on physical
examination. Physical abuse is most often identified on examination. In cases of sexual abuse,
there are often no signs on physical examination.
Identifying those at risk
A number of risk factors for child abuse have been identified in populations of people. However,
child abuse can occur in families with few apparent risk factors. Conversely, most parents at risk
of abusing their children never do so. The presence of risk factors should raise your concern, but
the starting point must always be evidence of abuse.
The young mother who denies her pregnancy, seeks a termination of it, fails to prepare for the
birth, and neglects her own health by smoking, drinking and abusing other substances, is at
risk. Parents who were themselves abused as children are at higher risk, as are those who abuse
drugs and alcohol and are facing multiple life stresses (e.g. financial, marital, and legal problems).
Parents who abuse may take their child to see numerous different doctors, and provide vague
explanations for injuries. Repeated presentations of a child with minor or vague complaints may
be a call by the parent for help.
Parents at risk of abusing their children include young women with unwanted
pregnancies, parents who were abused themselves as children, those facing
severe life stressors and those who repeatedly present their children to
doctors.
Children who suffer multiple accidents, and have a history of birth defects, failure to thrive,
feeding problems and developmental delays are at higher risk. An abused child may perform
poorly at school because of limited concentration. He or she may run away from home.
Examination
Observe the parents’ attitude towards the child and the way the child interacts with you. Note
any absence of normal fear and pain responses. The child may behave in a pseudo-mature way
and display inappropriate sexual knowledge or behave in a seductive manner.
Carefully document the location, size and appearance of any injuries. The following injuries
should arouse suspicion of physical abuse:
1. Fractures
•	 in children under nine months of age
•	 two or more fractures at different stages of recovery
•	 fractures in which the injury is inconsistent with the explanation given.
2. Bruises
•	 on the face or earlobes
•	 on the buttocks or thighs
•	 in the shape of a causative implement
•	 patterned bruises (e.g. grip marks)
•	 over soft areas as opposed to bony prominences.
3. Head Injury
•	 subdural haematoma
•	 retinal haemorrhages.
4. Burns
•	 immersion burns
•	 tap burns
•	 in unusual sites (i.e. non-contact areas).
Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 259
5. Closed abdominal injuries
Abuse may be revealed in a child’s drawings. The frightened child may assume an attitude
of ‘frozen watchfulness’. Pregnancy in a young woman under the age of 16 years, or the
diagnosis of venereal disease, raises the possibility of sexual abuse.
Action
It is mandatory to report cases of suspected child abuse in all states of Australia except Western
Australia. Make yourself familiar with the legal requirements in your state. Have at hand a list of
specialists whom you can contact—a local paediatrician who is involved in child protection (in
Queensland, this would be the person who sits on the local Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect
panel, SCAN); the Department of Family Services; the police; and a crisis line (in Queensland:
Crisis Care). If you are unable to contact any of the above, you can phone the major paediatric
hospital in your state and speak to the paediatrician on call for suspected child abuse.
It is mandatory to report cases of suspected child abuse in all states except
Western Australia.
While the factors mentioned above might raise the possibility of abuse, it is clinical evidence
that you require in your assessment. It is not your role to investigate whether or not abuse has
occurred, but rather to report and document as clearly as possible any findings suggestive of
abuse, and to arrange appropriate treatment and referral.
Try to be non-judgemental of the parents. In many cases, you will have to continue to support
them and the child. Be open and explain that you are required under law to report any case
of suspected abuse. This will deflect some of the parents’ anger away from you. It is generally
advisable to interview both parents together. To separate them may only make them mistrustful,
angry and uncooperative. A particularly difficult situation arises when allegations are made in
the context of a custody dispute. Try not to take sides. Base your conclusions on the clinical
evidence. Remember that it is not your job to decide guilt or innocence, but rather to report
your clinical findings.
Advice on parenting
Parents often present to general practitioners for advice on managing their children’s behaviour.
Parenting difficulties are stressful to parents. Positive management of a child’s behaviour will
improve his or her self-esteem and social functioning, and prevent problems in later life.
The principles of successful parenting are based on learning theory (see Chapter 9). Under the
operant conditioning paradigm, rewarding desirable behaviours increases their frequency, and
escape from aversive stimuli increases the frequency of avoidance behaviour. Similarly, removing
any inadvertent reinforcers reduces the frequency of undesirable behaviours. Social learning
theory notes that children can learn both good and bad behaviours by observing others—
parents, siblings and friends. High arousal attenuates over time (habituation) and the intensity of
responses diminishes on repeated exposure (desensitisation).
Any attempt to modify a child’s behaviour depends on the ability of the parent to communicate
clearly with him or her. The child’s attention must be gained, (e.g. by squatting down and
speaking face to face with him or her). The communication must be clear, understandable and
direct.
The following discussion highlights some aspects of the Triple P positive parenting program,
developed by the Parenting and Family Support Centre at the University of Queensland. Contact
your local community health service for information on the referral of parents with persistent
difficulties in managing their children’s behaviour to a Triple P group1

Causes of behavioural problems
A child’s temperament, including his or her sociability, emotional reactivity and level of activity
is determined in part by genetic factors. Parents often observe a wide range of temperaments
among their children. However, the behaviour of children is also influenced by a number of
environmental factors over which the parents have some control. Parents should be asked to
consider whether any of the following might be influencing their child’s behaviour. Examples
are given in Box 24-1.
Parents have control over a number of factors that can influence a child’s
behaviour
1. Accidental rewards
Unwanted behaviours may be inadvertently reinforced, and so increase in frequency.
2. Escalation traps
A child’s difficult behaviour may escalate in an attempt to get what he or she wants. If the
parent gives in, the child learns that escalating bad behaviour gets the desired result (it is
positively reinforced). Parents may also fall into escalation trap—the boy learns that he only
really needs to do as he is told when his father gets very angry with him.
3. Ignoring desirable behaviour
Unless parents are attentive to their child’s activities, they may miss opportunities to reinforce
desirable behaviours.
4. Social learning
Children learn by observing others.
5. Ineffective instructions
Instructions may be ineffective for a number of reasons. There may be too many or too few
of them. The child may not be able to understand them. The instructions may be ill-timed,
too vague, or contradicted by the parent’s body language.
6. Emotional messages
Parents may criticise the child rather than the unwanted behaviour. This may lower the
child’s self-esteem and make him or her feel angry, guilty and ashamed.
7. Inconsistent rules
Rules will be ineffective if parents threaten certain consequences, but do not carry them out,
or if the consequences are inconsistently applied.
8. Parent’s beliefs and expectations
Parents may fail to discipline a child because they believe the child is just going through
a normal phase of development. On the other hand, they may have expectations for the
child that are beyond his or her developmental capabilities. Alternatively, they may blame
themselves for all of a child’s difficult behaviours.
9. Parental conflict
Conflict between parents is often manifest by behaviour problems among their children.
Parents need to work together as a team. Disagreements should be worked out away from
the children.
Child and adolescent mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 261
10. Parental illness and stress
A mother’s mental illness may impair her ability to discipline and care for her children. She
will need extra support at this time. Parents who are under stress will have less time to attend
to their children’s needs. All parents need breaks from the care of their children and time to
themselves.
11. Factors outside the family
Children’s behaviour is influenced by relationships with their peers, their ability to manage
their schoolwork, and by their exposure to the media—television, movies and computer
games.
Goals for children’s behaviour
It is often useful for parents to set goals for their children. Consider the normal developmental
goals shown in Table 24-4.
Box 24-1: Some preventable causes of behavioural problem
Accidental rewards
Charles is given food to stop him whining and complaining. His whining increases.
Escalation traps – child
Tom asks his mother for an ice cream. She tells him he must wait until after tea. Tom’s behaviour
escalates—he continues to demand the ice cream, he raises his voice and stamps his feet, and he starts
crying. Finally, his mother gives him the ice cream just to silence him. The next day, Tom is again
demanding a sweet before dinner.
Escalation traps – parent
James asks Lawrence to put on his shoes before they go out. When Lawrence refuses, James gets angry
and begins shouting at him. A pattern becomes established that Lawrence only obeys his father’s
instructions when James shouts at him.
Ignoring desirable behaviour
Amanda’s mother fails to notice that she has been quietly amusing herself reading.
Social learning
Andrew is in trouble at school for yelling, swearing and losing his temper. He is often witness to
aggressive confrontations between his parents at home.
Ineffective instructions
Paul winks and smiles as he tells Rory not to swear.
Emotional messages
‘You stupid boy!’ yells Roger when Phillip trips over in the kitchen. Instead, he might have gained
Phillip’s attention and said, ‘Don’t run in the kitchen. You may trip and hurt yourself and break
something. Walk in the kitchen. Run when you are outside. Now go back outside and come back in
slowly’.
Inconsistent rules
Sheila asks Julia to tidy her room and put her toys back in the box. Her father, Roger, tells her not to
bother as they don’t have time.
Parent’s beliefs and expectations
Rory’s parents fail to discipline him for climbing over the furniture. Invitations to visit friends are
becoming scarce.
Parental illness
Michelle is suffering from depression and has no energy to take notice of her children. She is unaware
that her son, David, is playing truant from school.
262
Promoting good behaviour and normal development
1. Developing positive relationships between parents and their children
Parents need to set aside time to spend with their children. Frequent short periods of time
are more effective than infrequent longer periods of time. Parents should spend time talking
to their children, asking about their interests and sharing their own thoughts with them.
2. Reinforcing desirable behaviours
Praise, non-verbal communications (smiling, hugging), and providing safe, appropriate and
interesting activities can reinforce desirable behaviours.
3. Teaching new behaviours
Children will imitate behaviours that their parents model. For example, if a girl sees you
keeping your room tidy, she will be more likely to do the same. When a child asks a question,
use the opportunity to go beyond the answer and talk about related topics.
An approach to teaching children new behaviours is to first ask them to do it. If they cannot, tell
them what to do and then show them how to do it. It is often useful to break the action down
into a number of steps (see Box 24-2).
A useful approach for teaching children new behaviours is ‘ask, say, do’.

A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 263
Praising and otherwise rewarding a child when he or she performs a new action will increase
its frequency. In some cases, it may be useful for the parents to draw up a chart of desired
behaviours with agreed rewards.
Managing misbehaviour
The consequences of misbehaviour need to be clearly understood, immediate, consistent and
decisive. Ask parents to consider the following suggestions. Examples are given in Box 24-3.
1. Set clear ground rules
These should be limited to a few clearly defined and understandable rules. Rules are best
stated in the positive (what the child should do), rather than the negative (what he or she
should not do).
2. Directed discussion
After gaining the child’s attention, the parent should state the problem and the reason for
it. The child should be asked to state the correct way of doing the task and then to do it
properly. It may be useful to ask the child to repeat the action. On successful completion of
the task, the child should be praised.
3. Ignoring minor infractions
Minor problems such as whining, speaking in a silly voice or swearing are often best ignored.
This does not apply to more serious problems, such as hitting another child. It is important
that the parent continues to ignore the problem and does not respond to any escalation in
the behaviour.
Minor infractions are often best ignored.
4. Giving clear instructions
The parent needs to get close to the child and tell him or her clearly what to do. Children
should then be praised if they do as they are told. If after about five seconds the child has
not obeyed, the parent should repeat the instruction once. If the child still fails to comply,
the parent should move to the next step—quiet time or time out.
5. Back up with logical consequences
If a child refuses to obey an instruction, it may be appropriate to withdraw an activity.
6. Quiet time
When a child refuses to change his or her behaviour as asked, the parent can use quiet time.
The child is removed from the activity and asked to sit quietly in the same room for a set
period of time. The length of time varies according to the age of the child, from one minute
for a 2-year-old to five minutes for a 10-year-old. The child is ignored while in quiet time.
Quiet time only begins when the child is quiet. After it is over, the incident is not mentioned
again and the child is praised for good behaviour.
When a child is in quiet time, he or she is asked to sit quietly in the same
room for a set period or time and ignored.
Box 24-2: Teaching new behaviours
Putting on shoes and socks
Nigel asks Juliet to put on her shoes and socks. When she says that she doesn’t know how to do it, he
shows her how it is done, beginning with putting on her left sock, then left shoe, then tying a bow
in the shoelaces. When she tries putting on her right sock and shoe, he praises her for each step that
she gets right.
264
7. Time out
Time out is used to deal with more serious misbehaviour—for example, hurting other
children, temper tantrums or refusing to comply with quiet time. The child is removed to
another room and must remain quiet for a set length of time. The room must be safe and
uninteresting. The child must understand the rules of time out.
A child’s behaviour may initially escalate when placed in time out. It is important that he or
she is not let out while still upset, as this will only reinforce the unwanted behaviour. Time
out begins from when the child becomes quiet. Time out is more effective than corporal
punishment because as well as being effective, it teaches the child self-control.
A child in time out is removed to another room and must remain quiet for a
set period of time.
Forward planning
It is wise for parents to plan ahead for activities in which behaviour problems can be anticipated.
This applies particularly to activities in which there is little for children to do. Parents are advised
to take toys or other diversionary activities with them. They should discuss the ground rules
for the child’s behaviour beforehand. In some cases, there may be opportunities for incidental
teaching. For example, on a long drive, parents can play ‘I spy’ and discuss some of the things
they see out the window. Parents should plan rewards for good behaviour, for example, getting
an ice cream on arrival at the destination. Consequences for misbehaviour should be discussed
and understood.
Box 24-3: Managing unwanted behaviour
Set clear ground rules
Ground rules might include: when going for a walk, stay on the footpath; keep your hands and feet to
yourself; wash your hands after using the toilet; greet people when they come to the door.
Directed discussion
Rosemary fails to greet her grandparents when they arrive for lunch. Her mother, Sue, gains her
attention and says, ‘It is rude to ignore people when they come to visit. You should greet people when
they arrive’. Later, they practice it. Sue knocks on the door and Rosemary opens it, greets her and
asks her in.
Backing up with logical consequences
Alex is sitting watching television with his feet on the couch. When he refuses to move, his mother
turns the television off for five minutes. After he sits quietly with his feet on the floor for five minutes
she turns it back on.
Quiet time
David keeps interrupting his brother Steven who is telling the family what happened to him at school.
His mother tells him, ‘David, stop interrupting your brother. Listen to what he is saying’. When he fails
to obey, she says, ‘You have not stopped interrupting. Now go to quiet time. You can come back to the
table after you have been quiet for five minutes’.
Time out
John is having a tantrum. His mother gains his attention by squatting down beside him, looking him
in the face and saying, ‘John, stop yelling. Speak calmly’. When the behaviour continues, she says, ‘John,
you are still screaming. Now go to time out’. She takes him to the bathroom, which is the agreed
time-out room. The door is left open. She says, ‘You must be quiet for five minutes. Then you can
come out’.

Doctors’ mental health
While medical practitioners are healthier overall and have a longer life expectancy than people
in the general population, they suffer higher rates of alcohol and other substance abuse, mood
disorder and death by suicide. Their marriages are subject to particular stressors and, like others in
the caring professions, they are at risk of suffering burnout. The causes of this excess psychiatric
morbidity include certain personality traits common among doctors, the stresses of the work,
and the barriers that exist to adequate prevention and treatment. A number of facilities have
been set up to deal with doctors’ mental health problems. General practitioners should be aware
of steps that they can take to prevent developing mental health problems, and where they can
get timely and effective treatment for themselves and their colleagues.
General practitioners need to be aware of steps that they can take to prevent
developing mental illness, and where they can get timely and effective
treatment for themselves and their colleagues.
Epidemiology
The rate of suicide among male doctors is comparable to that of males in the general population.
The rates for females are reported to be similar to their male colleagues, or about four times that
for women in the general population. Rates of depression amongst doctors are thought to be
higher than in the general population, though this has recently been disputed1
. Around 30 per
cent of medical students suffer some emotional disturbance. This percentage increases during the
period of training. The prevalence among junior doctors is reported to be as high as 50 per cent.
Around seven to eight per cent of doctors drink to excess. The prevalence of substance abuse is
around one per cent. Some addicted doctors may have begun using drugs to self-treat anxiety
and depression, or as a maladaptive way of dealing with stress. Rates of divorce amongst female
doctors are higher than for male doctors, and for women in the general population. Marital
difficulties may contribute to or be a consequence of mental health problems.
People working in the caring professions are at risk of developing the syndrome of burnout.
Symptoms include feelings of fatigue, emotional exhaustion and apathy; a cynical attitude to
work with feelings of futility and hopelessness; a loss of one’s sense of humour; irritability and
anger; avoidance behaviours, including a reluctance to see certain patients or difficulty going
to work; clumsiness and frequent accidents; indecision and inefficiency; and persistent thoughts
of resignation. The condition may be complicated by self-medication with alcohol or other
drugs.
Compared with the general population, doctors suffer higher rates of
completed suicide, substance abuse, marital problems and burnout. They may
also suffer higher rates of depression.

Causes of doctors’ mental health problems
Factors in the formulation of doctors’ mental health problems include both predisposing
personality traits and coping styles that are prevalent among members of the profession, together
with stressors associated with the work.
Personality and coping styles
Around 20 per cent of medical students exhibit obsessive–compulsive personality traits, including
perfectionism, isolation of affect, conscientiousness, and a need to feel ‘in control’. These traits
are, in many respects, adaptive to the demands of the job. However, they also place the doctor
at risk. Perfectionism may contribute to a high level of performance, but at the expense of
high levels of anxiety and excessive self-criticism if something goes wrong. It is an asset to be a
good organiser, but this trait can lead to personality clashes with others who also like to be in
control.
Obsessive–compulsive traits place the individual at risk of depression and
anxiety.
Traits characteristic of the Type A personality are common among members of the medical
profession—competitiveness, feelings of time pressure, impatience and irritability. Again, while
these traits are adaptive in many situations, they are also associated with increased physical and
psychological morbidity.
Stressors
General practitioners face the everyday difficulties of running a practice together with the
particular stresses associated with clinical work. Everyday problems include overwork, having to
rearrange appointment schedules and coping with interruptions. In an age of consumer activism,
people expect to be fully informed about the services delivered and want greater involvement in
decision-making. The rising cost of medical insurance reflects increasing rates of litigation.
Doctors are envied for their high social status. They are often portrayed in the media as being
greedy and overpaid. This can be particularly irritating for the general practitioner who has
experienced the loss in status of the profession, and who is struggling to make a reasonable
living. Unlike hospital specialists, general practitioners carry the full responsibility for their
patients’ care on their own. They need to keep abreast of new knowledge, not only in a specific
area, but also in the field as a whole. General practitioners working in a group practice face the
interpersonal demands of dealing with their colleagues and ancillary staff.
Clinical work is often very stressful. Doctors are exposed to the gamut of human suffering,
including death and dying. They may hear stories of abuse and even torture. Some of their
patients will be difficult and demanding. Treating colleagues and their families is often identified
as being particularly stressful. Doctors often need to make difficult ethical judgements, balancing
conflicting demands, for example, between the need to maintain confidentiality versus the
requirement to report abuse. They are often powerless to cure and limited in their ability to
minimise suffering, limitations that patients and their families are not always immediately willing
to acknowledge. Doctors are constrained by standards of behaviour, especially with regard to
sexual conduct, that are more exacting than those applied in most other professions. Those who
are professionally isolated, especially solo practitioners working in country areas, are at high risk.
Female practitioners face role strain having to strike a balance between the demands of work
and family.
Doctors’ mental health
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 267
Stressors on general practitioners include the everyday difficulties of running a
practice, criticism of the profession in the media, having to take responsibility
for difficult clinical decisions, and living up to the high ethical standards
expected of members of the profession.
Barriers to care
People suffering drug and alcohol problems often deny their illness. The stigma attached to
mental illness makes it shameful to acknowledge the problem. The man who needs to be in
control will find it hard to admit that he has a problem requiring someone else’s assistance. The
competitive person may feel humiliated at having to acknowledge his or her own vulnerability.
The man who isolates his affect and habitually uses the defence of reaction formation may be
unable to recognise his emotional symptoms or to accurately describe them.
Doctors may tend to deny their problems and those of their colleagues.
Denial of mental illness extends to our inability to recognise when colleagues are suffering. We
tend to identify with them and collude with their minimisation of problems. Even when we
recognise that a colleague has a problem, we may be reluctant to approach him, and feel bound
not to ‘dob’ him in.
Doctors make difficult patients. It is easy to assume that they know everything about the
problem and so neglect to educate them adequately about their illness and its treatment. They
often present late. Those with drug and alcohol problems may only present to treatment when
under pressure to do so from a professional body. They are frequently non-compliant and often
discharge themselves from inpatient care against medical advice. Regular urine drug screens are
often necessary to ensure abstinence from substance abuse.
Treatment and prevention
In this section, I first discuss administrative structures that have been set up to deal with
doctors’ mental health problems. I then outline some preventive strategies for use by individual
practitioners.
Administrative structures
A number of medical schools now provide counselling services for students and assign mentors
with whom students can discuss problems in confidence. Specific training is given in dealing
with death and dying, and with the difficult patient. The idea of screening for medical students
at risk of developing emotional problems is fraught with difficulties. Those who are more
anxious are often more empathic with patients and less likely to blame others for their mistakes.
Moreover, any method of screening runs the risk of being abused as a vehicle for discrimination
against minority groups.
Doctors’ health advisory services have been set up in all states. These provide confidential advice,
as well as assessment and referral services. Referrals may come from doctors themselves or from
their colleagues. Treatment is coordinated by a senior general practitioner and delivered by
senior specialists.
Doctors’ health advisory services provide confidential advice, as well as
assessment and referral services.
268
Negative attitudes to admitting one’s own vulnerability and a tendency to denigrate those who
run into difficulties have been prevalent within training institutions, but may be beginning
to change. Intern year was often a period of initiation in which new graduates were given
considerable clinical responsibility and left to either sink or swim, often with deleterious
consequences for patients. A sort of gallows humour is a feature of training hospitals and is
certainly an adaptive way of coping. Unfortunately, some people fail to realise where the joke
ends. One of the commonest defences against the sort of denigration that is inflicted on junior
doctors is the claim that it was ‘only a joke.’
Self-care for general practitioners
Consider the following in managing your own stress levels and mental state:
1. Reflect on your lifestyle and make changes where necessary. Ensure that you have a balanced
and regular diet. Allow time each day for breaks, lunch and physical exercise—for example,
a 30-minute walk. Schedule regular holidays and other breaks away from work, such as
conferences and education sessions. Rebut the voice that tells you that you cannot afford to
take time off, or that your patients cannot cope without you. Avoid professional isolation by
remaining in contact with peers, for example, through taking part in activities within your
local division of general practice.
2. Maintain a balance between family, personal and work commitments. Setting aside time for
your family and friends and for your own hobbies and interests will improve your health and
leave you refreshed for work.
3. Beware of using alcohol, cigarettes and other drugs to cope with symptoms of stress.
4. Take steps to make your work environment as pleasant as possible with adequate lighting,
sound insulation and ventilation. Choose comfortable furniture and select paintings and
other decorations that you find relaxing.
5. Learn and use a relaxation technique, such as controlled breathing, progressive muscular
relaxation, self-hypnosis, meditation or massage.
6. Use structured problem solving techniques to deal with difficulties as they arise. For
emotional processing, you need to be able to discuss your problems with others whom you
trust. This may occur to some extent within your own social networks, but it is also desirable
to find support among peers who understand the sort of challenges that you face.
Formally or informally constituted peer review groups can serve not only educational and
quality assurance functions, but also provide forums for mutual support. In particular, find
a colleague or counsellor with whom you can debrief after traumatic or other difficult
events.
7. Get your own general practitioner. Do not self-treat and never self-prescribe. Let your
general practitioner coordinate your care. Do not fragment it by making specialist referrals
yourself.
Every doctor should have his or her own general practitioner.
8. Use the Doctors’ Health Advisory Service for advice on your own problems or when a
colleague needs help. In Queensland, phone (07) 3833 4352.

Consumer and carer perspective

Living with mental illness – consumers’ and carers’ experiences
The purpose of this section is to provide an opportunity for general practitioners to gain some
insight into what it is like to live with mental illness. The section was written by people within
Logan City who are living with mental illness. Unfortunately, people like us are often described
in ways that only reflect the nature of our illnesses, such as bipolar, schizophrenic or even
obsessive–compulsive. We are also known collectively as ‘consumers’ of mental health services.
To enable the delivery of a reasonably concise message to general practitioners we address the
following questions:
•	 What is most important to tell general practitioners?
•	 What is it like to have a psychotic illness?
•	 How did others react towards me?
•	 How did general practitioners react towards me?
•	 What helped?
•	 What did not help?
We have included some vignettes from our life experiences to personalise this work—however,
the underlying theme of the article is that despite the illness or the labels used to describe it, we
are still people. Therefore, what we ask of our general practitioner is most often the same as that
asked of everyone in the community. That is, to be treated with respect and express a willingness
to help whatever the presenting problem.
People with mental illnesses ask to be treated with respect by their general
practitioners.
What is the most important thing to tell general practitioners?
First, I need to feel confident that I will receive continuity of care across different health care
settings. While it is sometimes difficult to establish a new relationship with a health professional,
this situation is exacerbated for a person with mental illness. Often there is an emotional
investment in the building of such a relationship. It can be quite difficult to start over and to
share quite intimate and often emotionally painful details from our life story with a relative
stranger. In general, I do not wish to be perceived as different from any other person in the
community; however, I accept that at times my behaviour will differ from societal norms to
some degree. When establishing or continuing a health care relationship, I need my GP to ensure
that appropriate records are accessed when necessary. This could help the GP to understand the
signs and symptoms of my illness.
There are times when I may need a longer consultation, however, I often feel that general
practitioners are reluctant to give of their time. To enable me to express my needs completely, I
need to feel that my GP is willing to spend some time getting to know me as a person. There
have been times when I have visited my GP and left without saying what it was I wanted to say.
I like to feel that I have been listened to and not just heard.
Chapter 26
270
I need to know that I can approach a GP when I am unwell and feel I can talk freely without
being feared. I want to be treated with respect, not fear. When I appear to be unwell because
of my presenting symptoms, I am not absent from the room. I continue to be aware of other
people and their reactions to me. It can be quite hurtful to be discounted as a person because
of presenting symptoms. I do not believe that I pose a physical threat to my GP or others in the
community. I am a person with an illness and not the diagnosis (label). I should always be treated
with respect and fairness and not with fear and uncertainty.
In the early stages of awareness of my illness, my first contact with a health professional was with
my GP. When my illness first became noticeable, my GP dismissed symptoms as less serious than
they were in reality. This caused a significant amount of personal stress for me, because I feared
that there was something seriously wrong. The symptoms were real for me; however, I did not
understand what was wrong or why it was happening. Nor could I express adequately what was
happening to me. It would have been helpful for me if my GP had given me some more time
to discuss my concerns.
It appears to me that good communication skills are needed to gather all information required
to assess an individual’s condition. I believe that I need my GP to ask a sufficient number of
questions of me and to always encourage good two-way communication. I do not want to
suggest that it is the sole responsibility of GPs to communicate with me. I accept my share of the
responsibility for good communication; however, at times there are impediments to my ability to
communicate well. It is during these times that I need others to assist me to express my need.
Listen to people’s complaints, empathise with how they feel, and be sensitive to
verbal and non-verbal cues.
What is it like to have a psychotic illness?
This question appears to be best answered in adjectival terms, i.e. scary, painful, devastating,
isolating, debilitating, and not to mention bloody shitty. At times, I fear the consequences of my
own behaviour because I sometimes behave in ways that do not align with societal norms.
Others in the community do not understand or accept me at these times and this causes me
to feel that I do not fit in to society in general. The result is that I have isolated myself from
mainstream society in much the same way that an anxious person may avoid places because of
fear of other people noticing that something is wrong with or different about them. Recovery
from this fear and isolation is difficult and can take considerable time.
Suffering a mental illness is frightening, frustrating and depressing. People with
mental illnesses are often isolated.
Being hospitalised in a psychiatric facility was another significant issue for me. It was scary
when I was told that I had to stay in a mental hospital for a number of weeks or months and
be isolated from the world outside. I was devastated and I feared my own behaviour. I became
angry with people who found it hard to understand that unwell does not equal unaware. It was
difficult enough to cope with the outcomes of my own behaviour without others treating me
as though I had taken leave of absence from my physical self. The emotional hurt that this has
caused me is immeasurable.
Where possible, people generally prefer to be treated in the community rather
than in a hospital.
I felt a deep sadness about what was happening to me. I knew that each time I became unwell
my interpersonal relationships would suffer. I would lose so much in terms of love, security and
Consumer and carer perspective
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 271
acceptance of those I cared about. The fear of the illness that was created by these consequences
caused me to feel absolute terror. Underlying the terror, I am sure there was a deep sadness,
which remains with me now. It was not at all like when I suffered a serious physical illness.
Certainly, I might have been going into hospital to have my kidney removed, but my loved
ones still loved me and I didn’t feel as though I would quite likely lose my family life as I
knew it. I sometimes do not have control over my own thoughts, or control of events that are
seemingly happening around me. Although these episodes can be infrequent, the effects on me,
both personally and emotionally, are no less devastating. Hospitalisation used to be the most
common outcome. However, with the advent of community mental health caseworkers and
better relationships with GPs, early intervention can satisfactorily stop symptoms snowballing to
the point where hospitalisation becomes the outcome.
At times, I am unable to concentrate as too many thoughts are entering and rushing through my
mind. Everything seems very important, I do not sleep, I do not eat, and I talk a lot. Life seems
better for a while. It makes a tolerable change from being depressed. But then, so quickly, it can
all escalate and it is like a roller coaster ride that I cannot get off. I do not know at what point I
finally lose touch with reality, because it all happens too fast—the thoughts, the actions, the fears,
the hospital, the end of life as I have grown accustomed to it yet again.
I suffered a loss of my own standard of living. After my first psychotic episode, I feared extending
myself too much in case I became ill again. I was worried about returning to work in case it
added stress, which caused me to become unwell again. Each time I became unwell I would
suffer both financial and emotional losses. As a coping mechanism, I set up my life so that I had
less to lose. This form of control enabled me to feel safer with the illness.
My husband had great difficulty coping with the nature of my mania and also its periodical
reoccurrence. He always hoped that each episode was the last. Eventually it became too much
for him and we separated. As my illness also affects my ability to hold down regular, fulltime
employment, both of these factors have affected my standard of living. I have also lost contact
with a lot of people to whom I was close. There is a tremendous amount of personal loss incurred
as a result of periodic bouts of severe mental illness, which includes behaviour so extreme that
people around me often never forgive or forget.
People with mental illness have often suffered significant losses, including jobs,
financial security and personal relationships.
How did others react towards me?
People close to me initially reacted with disbelief and anger. I now believe this sort of reaction
is quite normal given that they were dealing with their own issues of grief and loss. However,
this was not apparent to me at the time and it was not easy for me to accept their reaction to my
illness. GPs could facilitate support for families of people with a diagnosed mental illness. This
could assist families to reconcile themselves more quickly to possible changes in their relationship
and lifestyle. Returning balance to the family would allow a more supportive environment for
the person with mental illness.
Involve the family and friends of people with mental illness in treatment.
Educate them about the illness.
Relationships with people outside of my immediate family also suffered due to my illness. Some
people reacted to me by withdrawing physical and emotional contact. When my boyfriend of
three years heard about my illness I found he didn’t ring me as often. When he visited me in
hospital he said to me, ‘ So what have they brainwashed you into thinking you have exactly?’
When I told him of my condition an uncertain look came to his face and I realised he had
272
trouble accepting my illness. From that point onwards we didn’t see each other as often and he
didn’t phone.
People may react to those with mental health problems by rejection, fear, anger
or criticism.
There were people outside my family whom I perceived reacted towards me with fear and
uncertainty. When new neighbours moved in next door to me they called to ask me ‘Are you
really crazy?’ They had apparently found out from someone that I had a mental diagnosis. They
had called to ascertain whether I was someone that they should be cautious of. Most people in
the community know little about mental illness. The little that is known is built on assumptions
and misinformation. It is difficult to reassure people who have an uninformed opinion of people
with mental illness. If there were a way to better educate the wider community about mental
illness, it would no doubt benefit mental health consumers.
Due to a lack of understanding of my illness, people generally assumed that I could no longer
do many things for myself.
After she found out about my illness my mother often said to me that she hoped one day I
would wake up and get more involved in doing the housework. Actually, she didn’t let me do
any of the housework, because she seemed to think that I could no longer do things for myself.
However, when she fell sick I ran the household for a week. I cooked dinner, did the dishes,
vacuumed and did the laundry.
There appear to be negative attitudes in the community towards people who appear to be
physically fit and yet do not hold a full-time job. People look at me as though I chose to do
nothing and will not find work because for much of the time there are no external signs of my
illness.
On the telephone, a friend of mine asked whether I was employed. When I replied ‘no’, they
responded with a comment, ‘It is unfortunate you haven’t got a job. You could get a job if you
really tried’. I explained that my illness prevented me from working, but despite my efforts, they
could not understand this and went on to call me lazy.
How did general practitioners react towards me?
It has sometimes been difficult to gauge GPs’ reactions to me. It appears that without the
necessary skill base it is difficult for them to establish a satisfactory therapeutic relationship. They
therefore tend to want to treat the physiological symptoms only. In the past, I have attempted
to discuss psychiatric issues only to feel as though there was no common ground on which we
could meet.
Generally, I have found that some GPs related to me in much the same way as the general
community. That is, I feel that I have at times perceived fear and apprehension. While this is
probably to be expected, because GPs are people too, I like to think that professionalism wins
through in the end and I will be responded to as an individual with a manageable illness. It
certainly helped when my GP referred me to a psychiatrist and I gained some understanding
of my illness.
People with mental health problems want to be able to discuss their problems
with their general practitioners.
What helped?
I value caring and consistent attitudes and behaviours towards me. I need to feel that I am
important. I need to know that I will be treated the same way before, during and after onset
Consumer and carer perspective
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 273
of my illness. I need to be treated like a person and not have my self-esteem eroded. I need to
feel that I am important, but when I tell people that I have schizophrenia, they never want to
talk about it. I would love somebody to say ‘Oh, that’s interesting, tell me about it’. I need my
treating physician to be willing to address the mental level of illness, not just the physical and
vice versa. That is, sometimes when I have a physical ailment it is too easy to explain this away
as psychosomatic. At other times when the symptoms are psychiatric, my physician will seek a
physical cause. I need this to be acknowledged so that I can work with my treating doctor to
achieve early intervention for episodes of my illness.
Attend to both the mental and physical health of people.
I feel that I have been listened to, but when I was on the bed at my local GP’s office having a
skin cancer removed, he asked me what I did for a living. I mentioned that I had schizophrenia
and after that he changed the subject.
It was helpful when I was given an explanation of the illness and its perceived causes. I was then
able to explain to the people around me why I had been having difficulty. It was also helpful
to have access to appropriate written information about my illness. I find that the majority of
medical practitioners’ offices or surgeries do not have enough information, especially in the
form of pamphlets about mental illness.
I know of people in the community who have a mental illness and have their medication
managed by their family doctor. It would be helpful to have information about where to find a
GP who is willing to work with people with a mental illness (see also Box 26-1).
People with mental illnesses appreciate being able to discuss their illness with
their general practitioners, getting information about it from them.
What did not help?
The primary thing, which does not help, is an unwillingness or inability to communicate with
me. Included in the basket of apparent poor communication skills are mixed messages. Body
language, which conflicts with verbal rapport, leaves me feeling as though a person is not really
listening to me.
Box 26-1: Three stages of illness
Symptoms leave me in the same order they came. I have spent years at various stages, but now I spend
a few days at most and experience only the first three stages. The first stage can appear easily, after
I become overly tired or have been exposed to large groups of demanding folks with whom I feel
uncomfortable. I have learnt to watch for this stage and then to examine my recent environment.
Getting more sleep, in conjunction with some quiet, and a low sugar diet seem to aid in restoring the
peace.
Sometimes I go into the second stage, which can easily scare me. The fear alone exacerbates my
condition into the third stage. Physical illness can trigger many miserable days at this level of existence.
In all stages, but especially this stage, keeping calm is important. It is very important that I talk to
others. People who have helped in earlier crises can remind me of things I can do to regain control.
Sometimes it really helps for people just to acknowledge that I am feeling uncomfortable, and even
though they believe it will pass, they have empathy for what I am feeling. They do not try to argue me
out of my feelings, but comfort and guide me1

People may pick up non-verbal cues that suggest that the general practitioner
is not listening.
When I spoke to one particular doctor, his body language suggested to me that he wasn’t
listening. He kept fiddling with his pen in a nervous sort of way as I was speaking (see also Box
26-2).
There appears to be significant social stigma associated with mental illness. Community attitudes
toward people with a mental illness make it difficult for me to move freely in society. Not only
do others fear my illness, but I also fear it. It creates a barrier for me. I cannot change the attitudes
of everybody in the community and, as yet, the illness I have has been resistant to change. This is
not to say that I am unwell all the time. In reality, I am well most of the time, and people would
not know that I had a mental illness at all.
Conclusion
Persons diagnosed with a mental illness have the same basic needs as everyone else in the
community. It is important for people with a mental illness to have good rapport with their GP.
It is also important for GPs to have an understanding of mental illnesses, appropriate medications
and their effects. Most importantly, we need to have a GP with a caring and approachable
manner and a willingness to help at all times, especially when we are unwell.
It is also important to be aware of the power of labels in our society. It is better to relate to
people with mental illness as individuals, not as schizophrenics or obsessive–compulsive, etc.
The sooner the community is more informed and educated about mental illness the better.
We do not refer to people with a physical complaint by some label. It is unlikely that you will
hear about a diabetic thief, but you may hear about a schizophrenic shoplifter. Labels imply that
others with the same label will always behave in the same way and this is not the case. I am a
person foremost, and then I am simply an individual who seeks as normal a life as possible and
my deserved place in society.
Treat the person, not just the illness.
The experiences of two carers are described in Boxes 26-3 and 26-4 on the following page.
Box 26-2: Interventions that do not help
It does not help when professionals pretend to know about my illness and how to treat it when they
apparently do not. It is much better to admit the limits of knowledge and ability than to persist with
inappropriate treatment. I know there is still much ground to cover before the scientific community
fully understands the aetiology of mental illness. It is better to admit to me the limits of understanding
and treatment so that I do not build up false hopes and expectations about the recovery.
One day, in deep curiosity, I quickly read my hospital chart, left in my room by a careless intern. It
was then that I became aware of the words that labelled me. At first, I felt relieved. I thought, good—
they know what’s wrong with me. Soon they will fix it once and for all and end my torment. I was
influenced by the television doctor shows in which brilliant minds quickly ended people’s suffering. I
patiently took my medication and waited for the magic. It never came1

Box 26-3: Experience of a carer (1)
By the time my son was 17 he had become very angry and disruptive. I think the phrase we used then
was, ‘Here comes trouble’. That was the time he started to smoke pot. He moved to the coast at 20 years
of age where he slowly deteriorated, and lost all of his possessions and job prospects.
When he came home he would be abusive and would forewarn us about people out there who were
trying to kill him and would kill us also. He said these people were following him, and would shoot
him if they caught him.
At this time he wore a hat and said that the fluorescent light affected his brain. As he hadn’t seen a GP
for some time, I went back to the doctor who treated him during his growing years. I had voiced my
concerns to her and she suggested I make an appointment for him to see her. After his visit, the GP
suggested that he see a local psychiatrist.
Four years ago it took three months to get an assessment by a psychiatrist and by then he was back at the
coast. By this time my son was living on the streets of the Gold Coast. Again I approached the GP with
the question, ‘How could a person in his condition look for employment, let alone look after his well
being’. She suggested I ring the police and make arrangements to get him to be taken to the hospital for
an assessment. I informed my husband of my conversation with the GP and he was horrified to think
of doing this. Maybe if the GP explained the Mental Health Act more clearly at this time, my son may
have received his treatment earlier.
As another year passed, his behaviour got worse. He said the television sent him messages and certain
songs frightened him. Finally, the GP and myself persuaded my husband to take our son to the hospital
where he was given three tablets and sent home to return the next day. This was like a slap in the face,
as it took me two years to get him to this point. After much persuasion, my son and I returned to
the Logan Hospital where he was admitted for one month and was discharged with the diagnosis of
schizophrenia.
Box 26-4: Experience of a carer (2)
Our son really became withdrawn when he finished his schooling at the age of 18. Although, looking
back, he had become very shy while still at school.
He spent most of the following year playing his computer or listening to music. He also played club
football, although he didn’t really interact with his fellow team members off the field.
Eventually, he started a TAFE course in September of the same year. He found the TAFE course very
stressful, as he had to use public transport to get there and he was required to do work experience.
At the end of the sixth week, I remember he came running to the car, the happiest I’d seen him in
months. He said the world was going to change and God had selected certain people to help him. These
people were mainly in the music industry. I thought perhaps someone had told him this during the day,
but I was concerned about the sudden changes in his mood.
The next day, which was Saturday, he woke us by running through the house screaming and telling us
to look at the sky—God was coming. He told us he had seen a bright light in the sky during the night
and he was sure it was a UFO. He thought his father was some kind of demon and he could smell a
terrible odour. He was also experiencing strange sensations in his hands and feet as though they had
suckers on them.
We managed to calm him down, but by midday he still couldn’t relax. Our first thought was that
someone might have slipped some kind of drug into his drink at college the day before. He had always
been strongly against drugs, so we knew it wasn’t something he would have taken deliberately.
At this time, I decided to ring our local medical centre to get some advice. The GP on duty said to
bring him straight down, which we did. She took us in and had a quiet talk with our son asking him
his name, if he knew what day it was etc. She then asked him what he had been experiencing. When
he had finished, she asked him where he would probably feel most safe. He thought he would feel safer
in hospital. She then wrote out a referral for Princess Alexandra Hospital and he was admitted that
evening.
Although it was a horrendous experience at the time, I think the whole situation was made so much
easier by the sympathetic and caring attitude of our GP.

Appendix 2 – Mini-Mental State Examination1
This instrument can be used to give a quantitative estimate of the severity of a person’s cognitive
impairment, or to serially document cognitive change. A score of less than 20 suggests a diagnosis
of dementia, delirium, schizophrenia or affective disorder. Such a score is not found in normal
elderly people or in those with a primary diagnosis of neurosis or personality disorder. The test
is not expected to replace a complete clinical appraisal in reaching a final diagnosis.
Instructions for administration of mini-mental state examination
Orientation
1. Ask for the date. Then ask specifically for any parts omitted, e.g. ‘Can you also tell me what
season it is?’ Give one point for each correct answer.
2. Ask in turn ‘Can you tell me the name of this hospital?’, (and city or suburb, etc). Give one
point for each correct answer. Note that this instrument was standardised for use in hospital
populations. In general practice, you might ask the street and the practice name instead of
the hospital and ward.
Registration
Ask the person if you may test his or her memory. Then state the names of three unrelated
objects (e.g. ball, pen, key) slowly and clearly, about one second each. After you have said all
three, ask the person to repeat them. This first repetition determines the score (0–3), but keep
saying them until he or she can repeat all three, up to six trials. If the person does not eventually
learn all three, recall (see below) cannot be meaningfully tested.
Attention and calculation
Ask the person to begin with 100 and count backwards by seven. Stop after five subtractions
(93, 86, 79, 72, 65). Score the total number of correct answers. If the person cannot or will not
preform this task, ask him or her to spell the word ‘world’ backwards. The score is the number
of letters in correct order, e.g. dlrow = 5, dlorw = 3.
Recall
Ask the person if he or she can recall the three words you previously asked him or her to
remember. Score 0–3.
Language
Naming – Show the person a watch and ask him or her what it is. Repeat with a pencil.
Score 0–2.
Repetition – Ask the person to repeat the sentence after you. Allow only one trial.
Score 0 or 1.
Three-stage command – Give the person a plain blank piece of paper and repeat the command.
Score 1 point for each part correctly executed.
Reading – On a blank piece of paper print the sentence ‘CLOSE YOUR EYES’ in letters large
enough for the person to see clearly. Ask him or her to read it and do what it says. Score 1 point
only if the person actually closes his or her eyes.
Writing – Give the person a blank piece of paper and ask him or her to write a sentence for
you. Do not dictate a sentence—it is to be written spontaneously. It must contain a subject and
verb and be sensible. Correct grammar and punctuation are not necessary.
Copying – On a clean piece of paper, draw intersecting pentagons, each side about one inch, and
ask him or her to copy it exactly as it is. All 10 angles must be present and two must intersect to
score 1 point. Tremor and rotation are ignored.
Estimate the person’s level of sensorium along a continuum, from alert on the left to coma on
the right.

Appendix 3 – Structured problem solving
Use this chart to help solve problems that are causing you stress. If problems are not dealt
with, they often worsen and cause more stress.
1. Make a list of the things that are worrying you.
2. Choose the problem that you want to deal with first and write it down as a need or a
goal (e.g. ‘I need to find a job’, rather than ‘I don’t know what to do with myself’. Or,
‘I need to have more money in the bank’, rather than ‘I haven’t got enough money’).
3. Write down all the possible solutions you can think of. List all solutions, including bad or
silly ones—the aim, at this stage, is not to decide if a solution is good or bad. You might
want to ask other people whom you trust to suggest some other possible solutions.
4. Beside a list of the possible solutions, draw two columns and write in them the advantages
and disadvantages of each. Your GP or another person you trust may be able to help you
with this.
5. Choose the best solution. It does not have to be the perfect solution—there rarely is such
a thing. But it is better to try some solution than to do nothing at all.
6. Write down the steps needed to carry it out. Include the things you need to do, the
resources that you require (e.g. a car or a day off work), the hurdles you need to overcome,
and the time you anticipate that it will take. You may need to rehearse some of the steps
(e.g. a difficult interview or phone call). Decide on your goals so that after you have put
the plan into action, you can assess how well it worked (for example, the goal might be
having more money in the bank, going out with friends once a week, or having fewer
arguments with your spouse).
7. Put the plan into action.
8. Review how effective the solution was. First of all, congratulate yourself on trying to
solve the problem rather than doing nothing. What have you achieved? What problems
remain? Should you continue with the current solution, modify it or try a different
approach?
9. Repeat the process for the remaining problems.
Note: When you are under severe stress, your ability to solve problems is often impaired.
Avoid making major life decisions in the midst of a crisis.

Appendix 4 – Controlled breathing exercises
Appendices
1. Monitor your breathing rate
Use your watch to monitor the number of breaths you take per minute at rest. The
normal rate is between 10 and 14.
2. Diaphragmatic breathing
When people are anxious they tend to use muscles that lift the rib cage to breathe. When
they are relaxed, they breathe using the diaphragm, a large muscle that stretches across the
bottom of the rib cage and works like a large piston (see diagram below).
•	 Sit upright or lie flat.
•	 Place both hands across the upper abdomen, just below the rib cage, with the fingers
of one hand just touching the fingers of the other hand.
•	 Breathe in through your nose.
•	 As you breathe in, the fingers will move apart.
3. Slow breathing exercise
When people are anxious they tend to over breathe. This then worsens the anxiety and
can cause a number of physical symptoms: dizziness, chest pain, tingling in the fingers,
a choking feeling, rapid heart rate, cold sweats, nausea, muscle tension and fatigue. This
exercise helps you to slow your breathing down to a normal rate.
•	 Take a normal diaphragmatic breath.
•	 Hold your breath for 10 seconds.
•	 Breathe out. As you do so, say the word ‘relax’.
•	 Then breathe in and out in six-second cycles, three seconds in and three seconds out.
Say ‘In, two, three’ as you breathe in, and ‘Relax, two, three’ as you breathe out.
•	 After a minute (10 breaths), hold your breath for 10 seconds and repeat the cycle.
•	 Do the exercise for around five minutes.
4. Check your rate of breathing
On completion of the exercise, record your breathing rate again.
Inhale Exhale
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 283
Appendix 5 – Progressive muscular relaxation
This method of relaxation involves tensing muscle groups in sequence.
•	 Find a quiet place where you will not be interrupted for at least 20 minutes.
•	 Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor.
•	 Close your eyes.
•	 Perform the controlled breathing exercise for five minutes.
•	 Tense each of the following muscle groups for five seconds as you breathe in. Then relax
for five seconds as you breathe out and say ‘relax’.
Hands – clench fists
Forearms – bend hands up at the wrist
Forearms and upper arms – bend your elbows and tense your upper arm and forearm
Shoulders – lift your shoulders
Neck – move your neck forward, then back, then to the left, then to the right
Neck – turn your head to the right, then to the left
Neck – tense the muscles at the front of your neck
Forehead and scalp – raise your eyebrows
Face – screw up your eyes
Jaw – clench your teeth
Jaw – open your mouth wide
Chest – breathe in deeply
Abdomen – pull in your abdomen
Back – tense your back muscles as if lifting a heavy weight
Buttocks – tighten your buttocks
Calves and hamstrings – pull your heels against the floor
Thighs – push your toes into the floor
Calves – bend back your feet
Feet – curl your toes down
• Continue the controlled breathing for five minutes.
Note:
• You will need around 20 minutes to complete this exercise.
• You can use the same principles to relax specific muscle groups when you notice they are
becoming tense.
• You can perform similar exercises while standing, e.g. standing on tiptoe, clasping your
hands behind your back, pressing the palms of your hands together in front of you etc.
• Audiotapes are available from Queensland Health that take you through the exercise.
284
Appendix 6 – Self-hypnosis
Self-hypnosis can help you take your mind off your things you are worrying about and make
you aware of things in your environment that can help your body to relax and make you feel
safe. The more you practice it, the better you will get.
Say 5 things you can SEE around you.
Say 5 things you can HEAR around you.
Say 5 things you can FEEL in your body.
Say 4 things you can SEE around you.
Say 4 things you can HEAR around you.
Say 4 things you can FEEL in your body.
Say 3 things you can SEE around you.
Say 3 things you can HEAR around you.
Say 3 things you can FEEL in your body.
Say 2 things you can SEE around you.
Say 2 things you can HEAR around you.
Say 2 things you can FEEL in your body.
Say 1 thing you can SEE around you.
Say 1 thing you can HEAR around you.
Say 1 thing you can FEEL in your body.
It does not matter if you use the same things to see, feel or hear when repeating the exercise. At
the end of the exercise, take a deep breath in and slowly out again, saying the word ‘calm’.

Appendix 8 – Treatment of agoraphobia by exposure to the
feared situation
After people have suffered a panic attack, they often avoid the place where it occurred for
fear they will have another panic attack. Later, they may fear going to other places. Their lives
become increasingly dominated by their fears, and they may finally be unable to leave the
house unless accompanied by their spouse or a close friend.
The aim of this treatment is to break this cycle, overcome your fears, and once again feel
comfortable going out.
1. Use the slow breathing technique and the progressive muscle relaxation before each step.
You can also use these exercises to control your anxiety in the feared situation.
2. Make a list of the situations that make you feel panicky or fearful.
3. Arrange them in order from least fearful to most fearful.
4. Choose one that you feel can cope with.
5. Write down the specific fears you have about that situation (e.g. at the cinema, that you
won’t be able to get out).
6. Make a list of the steps that you will need to take.
For example: going to the cinema:
•	 go with friend and sit outside
•	 go alone and sit outside
•	 go with friend and sit in the foyer
•	 go alone and sit in the foyer
•	 go with friend to a weekday matinee and sit near the door
•	 go alone to a weekday matinee and sit near the door
•	 go with friend on a Saturday night and sit near the door
•	 go alone on a Saturday night and sit near the door
•	 go with friend on a Saturday night and sit in the middle of the theatre
•	 go on a Saturday night alone and sit in the middle of the theatre.
7. Put the first step into action.
8. It is important that you stay in the situation until your anxiety has lessened.
9. Monitor your level of anxiety and notice how it starts to decrease the longer you stay in
the situation.
10. Wait until you no longer feel anxious before moving to the next step.
Note: Aim to do without any ‘safety aids’. These might include having other people with you
(as in the example), or using devices such as mobile phones. The treatment requires you to
confront your anxiety at each step.

A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 287
Appendix 9 – Recording feelings, automatic thoughts and the
situations in which they arise
People often talk to themselves mentally. However, they are not always aware of this self-talk.
It is useful to identify your self-talk at times when you are experiencing unpleasant feelings.
You can then examine and, when appropriate, challenge these thoughts.
The best approach is to record your feelings and thoughts near to the time that you experience
them. Draw three columns on a piece of paper. In the first column record the situation you
are in. In the second describe the feeling. In the third, write down your automatic thoughts.
Some words used to describe feelings include: angry, annoyed, anxious, ashamed, blue,
depressed, devastated, disappointed, disgusted, down, elated, embarrassed, frustrated, guilty,
happy, humiliated, insecure, irritable, looked down on, miserable, nervous, sad, scared, terrified,
unhappy, unloved.
The thoughts that you particularly want to identify are those that give a negative personal
meaning to the situation in which they arise. For example, a man feels miserable when he
fails to get the job that he applied for. The voice in his head is saying, ‘I’m a failure’. Some
thoughts are predictions about what the event means for the future. For example, the man
mentioned above may think, ‘Now I will never get a job’. Others reflect on how we think
others will react to us, for example, ‘Everybody will think I am a fool’.
For the purposes of this exercise, some thoughts do not need to be recorded. Thoughts that are
descriptions of how you feel should be recorded as feelings (for example, ‘I feel embarrassed’).
Descriptions of your thinking or experience should not be recorded either (for example, ‘I
could barely think straight, it was so stressful’). Instead, try to recall the thought itself and
record that (for example, ‘I will never be able to get this right’).
Situation Feeling Thought
I did not get the job. miserable I’m a failure. Everybody will
think I’m a fool. I will never
get a job.
He ignored me when I
entered the room.
disappointed and unhappy I’m a bore. He dislikes me
and thinks I’m unattractive.
I will never be popular.

Appendix 10 – Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)
Name_________________ Examiner_______________
Date_________________
Examination procedure
Either before or after completing the examination procedure observe the person unobtrusively,
at rest (e.g. in the waiting room).
The chair to be used in this examination should be a hard, firm one without arms.
Ask the person whether there is anything in his or her mouth (e.g. chewing gum) and if there
is, to remove it.
Ask the person about the current condition of his or her teeth. Ask the person if she or he wears
dentures. Do teeth or dentures bother the person now?
Ask the person whether she or he notices any movements in mouth, face, hands or feet. If yes,
ask to describe and to what extent they currently bother the person or interfere with his or her
activities.
1 Have the person sit on chair with hands on knees, legs slightly apart and feet flat on the floor.
(Look at entire body for movements while in this position.)
2 Ask the person to sit with hands hanging unsupported—if male, between legs, if female and
wearing a dress, hanging over knees. (Observe hands and other body areas.)
3 Ask the person to open mouth. (Observe tongue at rest.) Do this twice.
4 Ask the person to protrude tongue. (Observe abnormalities of tongue movement.)
Do this twice.
5 *Ask the person to tap thumb, with each finger, as rapidly as possible for 10–15 seconds;
separately with right hand, then with left hand. (Observe facial and leg movements.)
6 Flex and extend the person’s left and right arms (one at a time), noting any rigidity.

Appendix 11 – Treatment of sleep disturbance
History
In taking the history, note the following:
1. The presenting complaint
•	 the pattern of the sleep problem – difficulty falling asleep, early morning wakening,
broken sleep or unrefreshing sleep
•	 the duration of the problem,and any precipitants
•	 daytime drowsiness – in particular, ask about the ability to stay awake during passive or
dull activities
•	 the daily routine – getting up, going to work, taking naps, going to bed
•	 associated symptoms – for example,in sleep apnoea,there may be morning headache and
confusion
2. Drug and alcohol history
The following prescription drugs may interfere with sleep:
•	 steroids
•	 theophylline
•	 decongestants
•	 benzodiazepines, especially during withdrawal (Short-acting benzodiazepines such as
alprazolam can cause early morning wakening due to withdrawal.)
•	 anti-depressants,including MAOIs,SSRIsand moclobemide,especially early in treatment
or following a dose increase
•	 chemotherapeutic agents
•	 thyroid replacement hormones
•	 oral contraceptives
•	 anti-hypertensives, including beta blockers and alpha methyl dopa.
Non-prescription substances that can cause insomnia include:
•	 alcohol
•	 nicotine
•	 caffeine
•	 amphetamine
•	 cocaine
3. Relevant medical history
In particular, the following interfere with sleep:
•	 congestive cardiac failure
•	 chronic airway disease
•	 any condition that causes pain, for example arthritis and peptic ulcer
•	 diabetes may cause sleep problems through painful neuropathies or hypoglycaemic
episodes
• 	 Parkinson’s disease
290
4. Past psychiatric history
The following are commonly associated with sleep disturbance:
•	 depression
•	 panic disorder
•	 mania
•	 generalised anxiety disorder
•	 post-traumatic stress disorder
•	 anorexia nervosa
•	 schizophrenia
5. Collateral history from spouse or partner
People with sleep apnoea will typically have episodes of snoring that grow in volume until
interrupted by a period of apnoea (see below). The partner may provide the history, clarify
any stressors or other precipitants, and confirm the person’s alcohol and drug history.
6. Sleep diary
The commonest cause of daytime sleepiness is not getting enough sleep, something that the
person may not be aware of until asked to document it. The diary may also uncover other
problems in sleep hygiene (see below).
Diagnosis and treatment
1. No diagnosis
People are sometimes unaware that sleep requirements vary from one person to another.
They may present complaining that they do not get as much sleep as other family members,
or that they do not sleep a particular number of hours. If there has been no recent change in
the pattern of sleep, and if the person is fully refreshed by his or her sleep and experiences
no daytime sleepiness, then the pattern is probably normal for that individual.
Treatment:
Education and reassurance
2. Disrupted sleeping habit
Making a sleep diary will often indicate that the person, because of work, domestic and social
commitments, simply does not allow enough time for sleep. Sleeping-in over the weekend
may further exacerbate the problem. Similarly, many people develop disrupted sleep in the
face of stress. The pattern may then continue even after the stress has been resolved.
Treatment:
Improve sleep habit (see guidelines for improving the sleep habit, Table 14-3)
3. Disorders of the sleep/wake cycle
People at risk of these disorders include those travelling frequently across different time
zones, for example, airline staff, shift workers, and people with chaotic sleep patterns. There
is considerable variation in the ability of individuals to adapt to these changes.
Treatment:
Education (see Table 14-3)
4. Insomnia due to a physical condition
Treat the underlying condition There may be a coexistent mental disorder (e.g. depression
or anxiety).
Appendices
A Manual of Mental Health Care in General Practice 291
5. Insomnia due to a mental disorder
Treat the primary disorder.
a) Adjustment disorder – This is probably the commonest cause of sleep difficulties among
people presenting to general practitioners. The disrupted sleep patterns may persist after
the stress has been resolved.
Major depression is often accompanied by early morning wakening, but may present
with any of the patterns of insomnia. Sometimes depression is associated with an increase
in sleep time.
b) Anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress
disorder) – The most typical pattern is difficulty getting to sleep. People suffering posttraumatic stress disorder may suffer nightmares of the traumatic event.
c) Mania – There is, typically, a decreased need for sleep
d) Schizophrenia – The sleep pattern is often disrupted in acute psychosis. People with
chronic schizophrenia may have a reversed sleep cycle, sleeping through the day and
staying awake through the night.
6. Specific sleep disorders
a) Sleep apnoea – An apnoeic episode occurs when there is a cessation of airflow for greater
than 10 seconds. The diagnosis of sleep apnoea requires at least five episodes per hour or
30 overnight. In central sleep apnoea, respiratory effort stops; in obstructive sleep apnoea,
airflow ceases despite an increase in respiratory effort. The apnoeic episodes end when the
person is aroused from sleep. The person may be unaware of this disrupted sleep pattern.
Complications include cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension and
sudden death.
It has been estimated that up to 40 per cent of people presenting with excessive daytime
sleepiness may suffer from sleep apnoea. The condition most commonly affects middleaged or older men. Obese men are at higher risk (Pickwickian syndrome). Sufferers
may complain of tiredness and an inability to stay awake during the day, but may not
report problems with sleep. The spouse may describe loud snoring, gasping, and apnoeic
episodes. There may be morning headaches and depression.
You may need to refer the person for sleep studies. These include measurements of
airflow, ECG, EEG and electromyogram recordings. Some centres require referral from a
respiratory physician.
Treatment includes the avoidance of medications or substances that depress respiration,
including alcohol and sedative anti-depressants. Various mechanical devices and surgical
procedures have been developed to alleviate obstruction.
b) Narcolepsy – This is a rare condition affecting around four in 10,000 people that is
caused by the frequent intrusion of periods of REM sleep during normal waking hours.
Symptoms include daytime sleepiness, sleep attacks, cataplexy (a sudden loss of muscle
tone), hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis (being unable to move on waking) and,
rarely, blackouts that are sometimes associated with automatic behaviours similar to
dissociative episodes (e.g. travelling somewhere and then forgetting how one got there).
Onset is usually before the age of 30. It is potentially dangerous because of the risk of
accidents.
Investigations include sleep studies, which reveal the rapid appearance of REM periods
after the onset of sleep (within 10 seconds). Treatment involves taking forced naps
regularly during the day, the use of stimulants (amphetamine or methylphenidate) and
tricyclic antidepressants for cataplexy.

Appendix 12 – Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)1
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was developed to assist primary care health
professionals to detect mothers suffering from postnatal depression, which is a distressing disorder
more prolonged than the ‘blues’ (which occur in the first week after delivery), but less severe
than puerperal psychosis.
Previous studies have shown that postnatal depression affects at least ten per cent of women and
that many depressed mothers remain untreated. These mothers may cope with their baby and
with household tasks, but their enjoyment of life is seriously affected and it is possible that there
are long-term effects on the family.
The EPDS was developed at health centres in Livingstone and Edinburgh. It consists of 10 short
statements. The mother underlines which of the four possible responses is closest to how she has
been feeling during the past week. Most mothers complete the scale without difficulty in less
than five minutes.
The validation study showed that mothers who scored above a threshold 12/13 were likely to be
suffering from a depressive illness of varying severity. Nevertheless, the EPDS score should not
override clinical judgment. A careful clinical assessment should be carried out to confirm the
diagnosis. The scale indicates how the mother has felt during the previous week, and in doubtful
cases, it may be usefully repeated after two weeks. The scale will not detect mothers with anxiety
neuroses, phobias or personality disorders.
Instructions for users
1. The mother is asked to underline the response that comes closest to how she has been
feeling in the previous seven days.
2. All 10 items must be completed.
3. Care should be taken to avoid the possibility of the mother discussing her answers with
others.
4. The mother should complete the scale herself, unless she has limited English or has difficulty
reading.
5. The EPDS may be used at six to eight weeks to screen postnatal women. The child
health clinic, postnatal check-up or a home visit may provide suitable opportunities for its
completion.
6. Response categories are scored 0, 1, 2 and 3 according to increased severity of the symptom.
Items marked with an asterisk are reverse scored (i.e. 3, 2, 1 and 0). The total score is
calculated by adding together the score for each of the 10 items.
